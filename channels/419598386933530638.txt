lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nais
im sad to see there's more than 1 WR period
not cause there shouldnt be
but because it means i dont get nick in my class
nor am i guaranteed to get anyone else
nick i love you bb ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wuv you 2<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>have fun in cs though
2nd semester gon be fun for you
uuuuuuu<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>even in SL?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you got an IA
2nd semester
6 weeks
of only the IA
nothing else<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>YOU NEED AN ADVISOR? I'M RIGHT HERE BUDDY<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>1st semster is actually learning stuff and taking quizzes
IM RIGHT HERE TOO
but alan is probably better<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well he does need a client and an advisor
nooooo\
nick you ought to be an advisor
you actually knew what you were doing
lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol that 90 i got
completely random<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nick I got a 91
case closed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i did the whole IA in like a week and a half
and never worked on it again
until i forgot my work schedule the night before and stayed up bs'ing it to make it look legit
and it was<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my work schedule was missing about half the stuff it should've
lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is there really any difference between Sl and HL?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HL is higher expectations, more advanced learning
another IA too
you're expected to make it way more complex than your SL one
although in SL you can use HL concepts and get extra points
the writing portion of the IA is worth more than your code on both
but dw
you got until early february
late  jan.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>writing portion of the IA?
its comp sci wtf<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
you'll see<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>_tell me_<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
o
or
later<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>_tell me_<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LATER

<|start-block|>ive done canvas stuffi n Javascript :^)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>everyone responds to learning it diffrently, i know some people who didnt know shit at the beginning were pretty well versed in the IA and got a good score<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah
put in effort
and always always always always
ask for help<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like i dont put in effort

is when you asked for a copy of mine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fucking lol
I don't think I did the last homework assignment
either out of spite
or laziness
probably laziness
whatever I would take like
maybe half a page of notes
for a 12 page reading<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i never really did like
the artistic assignments
out of spite<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I got one point off my japanese internment project

<|start-block|>and i spent legit 15 minutes on that internement stuff<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
all i needed to do right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>0 fucking sense<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>was put it on a sheet of printer paper
and then like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean he said it was a copy paste project
so that's what i did<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>maybe sketch out the executive order<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>shoulda just said you were amish and didn't believe in computers and you would've gotten a good score<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>where<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>2:40ish
in the scene where they're playing orchestra
ok
2:54 exactly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how am I gonna recognize you from 7 years ago<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and it's 5th grade cause the music teacher was mr murphy

<|start-block|>HE'S IN THE BACK PLAYING THE VIOLIN<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hard to miss
VIOLA

<|start-block|>5th grade
boi<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HELL YEAH PINE LAKE MIDDLE SCHOOL ORCHESTRA<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a d v a n c e d  l  e a r n i n g<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he's so
*proficient*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no i wasn't
lmao
i someone faked my skill
in a class of 13 kids<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>SHIFT INTO 9TH POSITION<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>somehow*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>C E L L O S L A P<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>god shifting on a viola is hard at first
especially one that's bigger than a large size violin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i
hmm
i dont think we ever did something where i had shift<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah cause why would a 5th grade orchestra do a song with shifting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but consider this
on a cello<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
orchestra was<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you have to shift your entire arm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>4-8th grade
well
4th-6th
and at 6th you *could* choose to go do guitar<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a lot of things are easier on cello
viola is so fucking hard<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but since we were a group of 13 we weren't allowed to<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>MFFFFFFFFFFFF<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but it's the basic shit that's the hardest on cello<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like when the japanese and spanish classes broke off the japanese class was 3 people<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>play a c sharp on the g string<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah it's the opposite on viola<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and the spanish class was 10<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>FUCKIGN IMPOSSIBLE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>shifting is so hard cause the finger board gets pretty big at like 16"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dude
I played cello from grades 6 to 8
all 3 years at plms
then I played ONE YEAR at skyline<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>DARRIN
COOK<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and quit and never looked backk
STOP<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i still play
since 5th grade
but i onyl did cook's class for one more year
in the audition one
cause evergreen has like 6 viola spots<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what did they change the name to?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>chamber orchestra
it was silver in freshman year<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*chamber* orchestra<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no longer
*green* or *silver*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>chamber orchestra
sounds like
a gun class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i stopped in 10th grade and then some of the good peopel did it 1 more year like jeesoo and lifan
then they quit after junior year<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lifan kept going?
damn I expected him to quit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he quit after last year
i think
idk
i have one friend who has had cook every year in silver/chamber
he legit did AM fitness 3 years in a row just to keep doing it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so jason
before you were here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
hello<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the orchestras were
green
silver
evergreen
where silver was audition-on
y
and evergreen was audition-only
across the entire district
green is where all the bad people go
and freshmen<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah
so its like
football
where
all the good people go to varsity
and then the shitty people are stuffed into a "team"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kind of
but
varsity got mr longman
skyline's old orchestra director, promoted to evergreen<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hold up
people use that name
outside of trying to hit on people?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hah wheres the piano for orchestra<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>now it's string, chamber, evergreen *AKA you're not gonna get in cause all the playing-since-5 people are gonna get in*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yesssssss<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*oh wait rip my musical skills*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's choir boy
yeah so
evergreen gets longman
silver and green got cook
who was retrofitted to orchestra
because longman left
and longman
was
LEGENDARY
cook
is
LEGENDARYILY BAD
what was it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why
does this exist
holy shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>half of the people in green left the following year?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey remember referrals
that was fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pffff<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and the admin literally told us that none of us knew music which, for the majority, was true but i took insult<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah
they called in the admin to discipline us
because nobody took cook seriously<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>did you guys ever do like
mayfair
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol
no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>k<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>i always get early in the morning
but i aint gonna sit with seniors to see the sun rise in rain<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>speaking of rian
rain
lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see like
the issue right

does not actually indicate what its like at skyline<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i want rain, i was getting tired of that  heat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya me too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>although we were the only corner of the country not getting hit by that heatwave<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rain is ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I live a mile away from skyline by car
it WAS raining
but it stopped<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>problem is if there's clouds aint noone gonna see no sunrise<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>parking passes at skyline are dumb
cmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what
even<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yummy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like

maybe once a month<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont get one
b/c
i dont live in the bus range
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what
isn't that exactly the reason why you *should* get a parking pass?
I tell you what
9 out of 10 days
I won't need this parking pass
I'll lend it to you for those 9 of 10 days
if you can't get one
<@!189852772475207680>
don't tell the kids in chinese<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>brb posted on snapchat
you checked sc didnt you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then snap this too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its basically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you can buy my god damn parking pass for $300 a semester you underclass freaks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if they actually check
my credentials<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright posted<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont get one
period
yeehaw<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do you think mr thorson goes out there with a tablet<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no but<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>checking each one of the 381 parking spots
and looking them up online
to see if the registration
matches the vehicle?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think they can look at my address
and know that one isn't in the bus zone
like where im living now is *Closer* to it
and it still dont get it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wanna use my address?
or how about the house across from me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont think i can<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nonono<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just going with the idea of<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you *shouldn't*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey lets not check anything
no like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the packet is all printed out and shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you
*could*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i *could*
i can also park at the park and ride
and just you know
walk 10-15 minutes
and skip the fucking traffic in the student lot
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's a big ass hill tho
you could try mary queen of peace or the other church across from school
that's where all the juniors that didn't get passes go<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>potentially
is it bad to just uh
park in redhawk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>make friends with someone who lives in redhawk
ezpz<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i feel like
thats hard<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>park at metro market?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
i think its that or park and ride
but metro market might get pissy about being there for 8 hours<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>could park at city hall
I've seen people do it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmmm
this is true
idk im crossing the bridge when i get there
or ill just take the city bus for the rest of the year
lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*exactly* how far do you live again?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>about 4 miles<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and there's no bus route for you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok so
more like 5.3
but ye
because this house is in the highlands
so i dont get a bus route
?
and you know<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what school district even covers that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>IHS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>um<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>once i move back into Montreux<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what does that stand for<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>issaquah high school
on cougar mountain<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh yeah that one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ill be even further<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>move *back*
wait when<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>supposedly november
i dont trust them anymore
cause they said 6 months to restore the damage
and its been
uh
14 months now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what the fuck happened<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my house burned down<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm not quite sure how to respond to that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm gonna go with
well okay then<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its not technically burned all the way down
its just the smoke and water damage basically made it the same thing
had to tear everything down to studs and build up as new
only like
the attic, the top floor and most of the middle floor was actually burned<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so wait is that the reason why you transferred to shs?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
i transferred to shs because my sister didn't want to go to ihs
and i dislike like
99% of the people at ihs
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how many people are at ihs?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh
when i was there
about 2,500
but prolly more at this point<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you're saying you like approximately 2 and a half people<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
thats
very accurate actually<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well shit
I bet you've already beat that by a lot since you got here
at least I hope<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean
lets see here
im friends with like
10 people?
at least
and i get along with a lot more
as opposed to
just hating everyone
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well that's an improvement over 2 and a half
so let's call that a victory<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><a:PoggersRow:488850025317793805><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah you really moved up
you became a co-coordinator for a competitive video gaming club
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
co-coordinator for the co-coordinator for the division that's probably dead this year
AND crew for drama club
pog
champ<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>don't forget
the *freshies*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you mean<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they compose half of the member base every year<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the new fortnite players
?
or how<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well yeah basically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we have like 50 people at the first meeting
and then suddenly
when people weren't accepted
it became like
7-10 every meeting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>y=1/x
that's our attendance graph<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what about like uh
negative part
?
like i'm not a math genius
but im pretty sure y=1/x has a negative reflection<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's the amount of shits I give by the end of the year<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmmm
how do you do days
negatively<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how much time debt I've gotten myself into<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmmm
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah our highest meeting attendance ever was like
83<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>damn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>our lowest was 7
consequently
the first and last meetings<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmmm
what even<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>last year's first meeting was actually the smallest first meeting to date
if we do things right this year, like publicity, scheduling, and avoiding other club's first meetings
we could see upwards of 80 again
maybe more because of fortnite
I'm predicting in the 70-100 range
solely because we're not doing it on a friday this year<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it depends
you need to like
*stress* the fucking fortnite
get a banner
with a large F on it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>:f:ortnite
dammit I thought that would work<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean
hold on<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yea no i dont have a fortnite emote
i have uh

there<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><a:ablobglarezoombutfast:407330915283369994><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i hope you know the freshmen and sophomores are legit intolerable<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eh
some are fine
mainly being like
the ones that listen to me
+ my sister<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>heavy emphasis on SOME<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya sure some are fine
i need to go back to being angry all the time
more people listened to me then<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@111635656479952896> I hate you but I'm going<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but it raining hard dood<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait now it is
ah fuck it I'll just go watch the shitshow<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@157341900502859776> i hate you too ??????<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@145664386021720064><|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Come
<@145664386021720064><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what
no
i went inside<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Relatable conversation I see<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why do I love this photo so much<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
its animal cross
that makes so much more sense<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>have you not seen the trailer
it's amazing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
like\
my family owns 2 switches
and i dont pay attention to what comes out on the switch<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>watch the trailer
it's so good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i never played animal crossing
is it good?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's
um
how does a game you play to relax sound?
that's what animal crossing does best<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so like
stardew valley?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>very similar demographic to stardew, yes
it's hard to describe animal crossing because animal crossing is animal crossing
at best you could say it's a life simulator
it's a you-play-30-minutes every day kind of game
it's a I-didn't-realize-I-spent-350-hours-on-the-last-one kind of game
it's a real-time game, where minutes hours and days pass in real time
holidays and special events happen
seasons pass when they do in real life
I say these things and sure it describes the mechanics but the feeling animal crossing gives you can't really be described because it's unique to everyone
It's the kind of game I feel guilty for not playing
almost like a tomogachi
or nintendogs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>JUST TRY IT FOR LIKE TWO WEEKS AND YOU'LL SEE IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont own
a switch
or a ds
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>2 switches in the house and you can't use one of them for half an hour per day?
you can legit just
yeet one
then go to school<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well you see
1 of the switches is my sisters
so 0 chance
the other switch is in the main house
aka the part i dont live in<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and that switch didn't get burned to a crisp or died from water damage, right?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
it was purchased post fire
but idk where it is
could be in storage tbh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well if you do find it
give animal crossing a shot
when it comes out in probably december
i know like 2 of my cousins are considering buying switches JUST for animal crossing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's five days until HSEL registration is due and we don't have an advisor
why am I not surprised<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Pog
Champ
Why have advisors
When you can just not<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Elbert and I talked to Trimble personally
Ofc it had to come down to this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Who is trimble<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>New Math teacher, tall and young like Garand<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I see<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yikes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>man they really did make registering for a parking spot as tedious as humanly possible<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>literally i didnt even do the online registration (because i couldnt) and i just went up, handed him my signature sheet; copies of my license, asb card, proof of insurance, and my car's registration; and the receipt where it says i paid for parking and he jut quizzed me and gave me the pass
it was not bad at all<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Ya
Fuck you trying to park
This is soviet Russia
Walk everywhere<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey alan, why is eeryone in this discord required to hae a 4-letter name>
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Because it's name communism<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Also the same amount of letters as USSR
So<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tru
but 3 is a more universal number
as per the word of Bede, it's an archetypal number<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Hmmm
You make a convincing argument<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so i'd be frn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>And fin stays functionally the same as finn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan'd be aln
bono would be jon
or bon, take your pick<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Oo
Can nick be nix<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nick would be nic(cccccccccccccccccccccccccccc)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Thats a lot of cs
Should toss some qs in too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>or just niq<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>4 is better
fck u<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Wow
China is four letters long
As is Cuba, Laos, and Vietnam<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well can we change your 4-letter name to niqc?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Niqq<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i feel it makes more sense that way
wait
woops
?
k we're bac
how do i change someone else's nickname?<|end-block|>

the BIGGEST IQ THESIS
for this hamlet essay
so basically
the ghost
is God
Hamlet
is the chosen champion
and Claudius
is the Devil
and God told Hamlet to seek divine judgement on the Devil
ISN'T THAT THE BIGGEST BRAIN THESIS YOU EVER READ?
<@!110137446053736448> HEY YOU'RE IN CS WHAT DO YOU THINK<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
String caesar2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
        char initial2; 
        int shiftVal2; 
        char finalLet2; 
        int shift = 0;
        for(int pos = 0; pos<caesar2.length(); pos++) {
            initial2 = caesar2.charAt(pos);
            shiftVal2 = (char)initial2 + shift;
            if(90<shiftVal2 && shiftVal2<(91+shift)) {shiftVal2 -= 26;}
            if(122<shiftVal2 && shiftVal2<(123+shift)) {shiftVal2 -= 26;}
            if(initial2==' ') {shiftVal2=(char)initial2;}//this makes spaces still appear as spaces, not as %s
            finalLet2 = (char)shiftVal2;
            System.out.print(finalLet2);
        }
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println();
```
it only works if shift < 27
how do i fix this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>keep track of what ranges the letters a-z and A-Z are
then if any letters go above that range
make them loop around<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats exactly what i thought i did
wait you actually changed the names to 3...
lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhh
are you accounting for both uppercase and lowercase ranges?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
separately
its the first 2 if statements<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what happens when Z is passed through
oh
hold on
you need to make it keep subtracting if it's greater than 26
because 27 - 26 = 1<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i know<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you subtract once
so if you have
100 - 26
it'll still shift over 74 characters
unlooped<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i know<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>make another loop to keep subtracting
make it stop once the shift is less than or equal to 26<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so basically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also indent your if statements<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in the loop
make it reduce shift
until its <= 26
okay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*nested for loops*
that's for tomorrow tho<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well, bitch, its for now now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well, it'll be a for loop nested in an if statement nested in a for loop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>funfact<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you can have as many nested if statements as your disk space/memory allows
but any more than 3 hurts readability<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I like to do 30 myself
Also <@157341900502859776> why not just talk about iambic pentameter<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because screw shakespeare<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>But like
Iambic pentameter is a get out of jail free card<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>B/c you can do anything with it
Opheila is restricting her thoughts by not talking in perfect iambic pentameter
Horatio speaks in a broken version showing how the death of KH is affecting all of Denmark
Hamlet maintains it in some areas and not others, indicating how he feels about certain aspects of his situation<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>+ all you need to do is bang on a table as you read it and it becomes clear<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i always sucked at that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Idk, in 10th grade at IHS they stressed it really hard<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>And since its almost always there and the lack of it means something, as long as you're willing to hit the table a bit it's decent evidence<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>IAMBIC
PENTA
METER<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>opheila spoke in iambic trimeter
wooooaaaaaaaaaah
in that last sentence<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I see the merit in using iambic pentameter
but it's also like
using diction
it's always there
but when it's not
it's important
but when it is
it's also important<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean like
diction and meter
is ez ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you can also talk about establishing social classes through levels of celestial imagery
but eh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>right
I've had it up to here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm taking a vacation from eSports Club until monday
if anyone asks for me, tell them to go to jonathan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>huh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Trimble just emailed Ken saying he's still confused about what we do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>l m a o<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it took Kenneth 2 weeks to contact Trimble *a single time*
I can't work with people like this
so I decided
I won't<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>makes sense<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do you wanna take over for me as atemp
not for exec stuff
just as like
head coordinator<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so
coordinating
coordinators
sure<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cool
I've given you admin on the esports server
good luck
and if anyone @s me
you should probably answer it for me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok
do i need to like
know anything in advance
or?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not anything you already know
you know more about the HSEL process than I do as a coordinator
so if another division's coordinator has questions
you know what to do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>@nick
<@!145664386021720064> you should probably know about this too
**GOOD LUCK BOYS I'M OUT**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh my
is it really that bad
jesus<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!111635656479952896> I'm actually really impressed with how you handled the trimble situation
I expected to come back to the exec chat in flames
but it looks like you helped everyone to sort it out<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also I didn't mean to give you access to the exec chat but it looks like that mistake paid off well
thanks for helping out
and<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye no problem man<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>the only reason i know about Flamingo is because its basically a meme on this one clone hero channel<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tf is clone hero<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>guitar hero
but free
and on pc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i see<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and you can download all the songs you want
its damn lit
i downloaded all dragonforce song
all 80 of them
slowly getting carpal tunnel going through em
thats the channel
the others of note are UKOGmonkey, randyladyman, JasonParadise (how i found out about it) and FrostedGH
randy and frosted i swear are not human<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean its called guitar hero
not like
guitar average<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>man
i thought the song
was gonna be giorgio
and i was all for that
and now im here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there's many a meme
thats half the youtube
its many a beautiful
i prefer the actual stuff though
if you want a meme that's not supposed to be a meme
watch UKOG do Operation Fire and FLames
he likes the combination of Operation Ground and Pound and TTFATF but its actually a shit mashup<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Good job spotify

<|start-block|>ya
i need to stop trying to name all 50 states in a minute
but its so fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>33/50
fuck me this is hard lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>35/50

<|start-block|>rapidito<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i *know* all 50 states
its typing them<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im not saying you dont<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in a minute
that fucks me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah
thats why you gotta listen to Rapidito<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how about
end of all hope<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wuz dat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Tiene que ser mas rapido<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>36
we're getting there<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>closer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh are you typing them out?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dude im sleepy as fuck do i stay home and do some extra hw or do i go to BC for my no-credit 3-hour pottery class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk dude
i got like
3 hours of sleep
and have a fucking company meeting tonight
of all nights<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*why* did  you get 3 hours of sleep?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>b/c a have a friend
who is bad at managing time
tbh it's not really her fault but like
ya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>she got a concussion like uh
4 years ago?
and has had memory problems since then<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dam<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>now this usually doesn't pose too much of an issue ye
but she recently broke up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o o f<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and she's not the best at remembering that she broke up
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh that sounds quite problematic
did she break up or was she broken up with?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>broken up with<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they ended up breaking up due to him moving across the country<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>must be an emotional rollercoaster to forget that all the time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah it's something
she's remembering more of it as time goes on
so eventually she'll be able to remember all of it
which i *think* is better<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i would imagine it'd be better cause then hopefully she'd be able to eventually make peace with it
if she keeps forgetting she'd continually get the bombshell dropped on her
of course i dont know how it goes for her
but i would think it'd be like breaking up again every day, or however frequently her memory lapses<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's been her reaction so far, yea
its getting like uh
more familiar to her?
she's retaining bits and pieces now, but she's still struggling to remember all of it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>progress, that's good " *i think* "<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like taking an axe to the face, proper memory loss is something i would like to experience just to have the knowledge of what its like. of course i would most likely want it to be reversible too, though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean like
i can think of a decent amount of sad memories i'd much rather just forget than have hang around me
especially not if it's going to feel fresh for a long time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>can't be selective with it though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and if memory loss were to follow anything close to standard memory, we're better at remembering the sad and bad stuff than the fun stuff<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're not wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>granted, since it's a concussion there is something of a chance of it going away eventually
as it was just one concussion and not repeated ones
but i dont think anyone is really betting on that now<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>"In Java 8, where is the method hashCode() declared, and what should be ensured so that any object that overrides hashCode() doesn't run into errors when implemented in hashing operations?"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>A: It's declared in the Object class; Any class that overrides `hashCode()` should ensure that any two objects with differing state return two different, unique hash codes.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"What's the name for a class that only contains variable members, and no methods?"
A: A `struct` or data structure class.
"What's a singleton instance class, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using one over a static class members?"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>A: A class that protects itself from existing as more than a single instance at a time, usually via a private constructor. It allows easier integration with non-static classes than a static class would.
"What method does a TreeSet use to compare values, and where is it derived from?"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan i think i about figured out the calculator<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>A: `compareTo()`, derived from the Comparable interface<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have yet to code it but i have figured out one that avoids getting errors<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well okay
but tell me again
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY CODE IT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i did some coding today on it
and can confirm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!157341900502859776>  i think i figured out my calculator code<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it does not give me error<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>can you take a look at it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!157341900502859776>
i think i figured it out
havent done it yet
yo does the calculator accept chinese<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"What's the big O notation of a LinkedHashSet?"
A: O(n), where n is the number of elements.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>^ that question was actually answered correctly, good on them<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>What<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm in Hendricks' classroom<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Wyd there
Jason and I are in the upper commons like every morning<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm here to keep working on a graphic arts project<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh okay cool<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I might need another vacation after this whole fiasco
Maybe after the first meeting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>You mean the meeting that's going to happen 2 weeks from now
Because trimble doesn't understand anything<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Or is everything gonna burn down<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>It will burn down<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have no idea
it looks like trimble will not do a meeting until we have a form signed
this comes mostly from the fact he's not responded to me yet
and any conversation has been
"you need a form for a room before a meeting,right?"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Facility use forms are generally used for large scale club operations, like the stage or gym
It's very uncommon to do one for a single room<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
and i've told him this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Most clubs just ask their advisor if they can use their room after school, or ask another teacher if they're okay with it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>everyone i've asked cant do it
trimble doesn't seem to have a room?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Okay if we're getting desperate, just go to the office<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*if we're getting desperate*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Just ask the office if there's a way we can have a meeting less than 2 weeks from now
Alright?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm going on vacation starting at 5 o'clock, with a short check in during the first meeting
I'm falling behind on homework and college apps and need to catch up<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>what even<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I need to go a step further than just not peeking in the server
I gotta be
*out* of the server
no notifications, no pings, no nothing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean
ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's a mental health preservation step
I'm gonna be tempted to peek into the server if I don't switch<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i c
my mental health
is described best by a lot of internal screaming
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>detach and relax
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this creates more screaming
i relax by taking baths
and curling up with my cat

were both absent<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>? E R E N I C E<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and so we have bio people and comp sci people<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>maybe we shouldnt have told your class that "bio is the easist ib science" cause it's kinda workin against you now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but no physics or chem
im so fucking tilted
luckily we got hepatology
aka liver and bladder
so just talk about alcohol<|end-block|>

what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><:POGGERS:493550630913310725><|end-block|>

<|start-block|>like if we discover something that can neutralize the effects of alcohol
and they meet certain conditions<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think the judges realize comp sci gets fucked in some situations<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in a program's if statements
then it will administer the thing
and save lives
automatically
without human intervention<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i literally talked about how

<|start-block|>do as you please, friend<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>reeeeeeee
seans not taking my bait
this is annoying
bope
nevermind he took the bait
sean now thinks i have a kid
ez ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>questions
why
how<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>master
i am the master at this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>get me in gddc
hello my name is WENDY STARFLOWER ALEXIS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!175049231709634560> also save that one for future use<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you look like you have no will to live in that picture alan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan shush and read this masterful bait i've just done<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sean please tell me you're joking
please
I appointed you as a coordinator<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I wonder if Sean has seen me with this profile pic before
I mean, it looks like me, minus the glasses
and Alfonse Wynn isn't too far off the mark<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you have completely destroyed this man's will to live
what have you done to this poor soul<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk
i didnt think
he'd take the bait<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>good joke<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i can die happily now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah cause you """passed on"""" your seed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>red?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>boi i can sow those oats you feel<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they're not too smart are they<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so uh
is the school still investigating
the raid<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk
the school is gonna make us
update our rules
most likely<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they haven't called me down to the office yet
so I'm guessing they either dropped it
or stopped caring<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>probably the latter<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im just waiting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its kinda funny how some delusional freshman thinks it's ok to post nsfw in a discord for a HIGH SCHOOL CLUB and get mad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for someone we banned to complain to the office<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>probably a freshman<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tbc, he posted an invite on a raid forum and the users from the forum posted nsfw<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im having trouble distinguishing freshman and sophomores, they sophomores are still pretty dumb<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and one of the raiders was kind enough to tip us off that we were vulnerable<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gene doesn't know<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im gonna feel bad soon
these people are too nice
dear lord<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look
as noone finds out we're screwing with them
nobody's gonna get hurt
so
just never let them find out<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan
i *literally* just convinced someone i had a kid<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>which discord is that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>***LITERALLY***
someone<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why are you two playin these fools<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>has to pick up on the fact
that i am not being genuine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the game design and development club discord<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>all around me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>want in?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>are familiar faces
worn out places<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LMAO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>familiar faces<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>SHIT I THINK TROY'S ONTO ME
HE KNOWS THIS PROFILE PIC<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh oh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
we're fine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no he definitely knows
or at least suspects
`Integer myInt = new Integer(5)`
is what they gave me
what the actual fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait
<:thonkang:363180983446536192><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he's not wrong, that's a legal initialization
but that's like
the most unorthodox way to make an integer I've seen unironically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!145664386021720064><|end-block|>

try him out
and if he's good enough<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i sent him an invite<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tell him he's currently in a tough position with the server right now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>saying that if he posts anything that sniffs inapprorpriate again, it's collateral damage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cool
<@!111635656479952896> delete the invite link<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>where
what
hgello<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>don't take risks, if an invite link is no longer needed, delete it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it had one use<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jono sent me one
not jason<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if another permanent link leaks onto a raid forum again
we might not be able to salvage the server again
jason can edit invite links
alright that's it from me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i was gonna say
for someone on vacation from esports<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just keep invites on high security
I KNOW I KNOW
IT PISSES ME OFF TOO

*heavy knocking*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so remember how we did the !b command in esports club
can i see that code again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>or more specifically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>should stil be in the latest pastebin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>someone has offered me
"if you make a bot that responds with bitch everytime someone says eat it ill give you admin"
THUS
i need your help
i must make it so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it should be pinned in the academy chat
the latest sourcecode for wendell<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's a fat no
fine hold on<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>You're interested in MessageEventListener
and Wendell<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so all i have to do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait
real quick off topic
will a while loop
consider if there is like a hasNext thing
so like
while (str.hasNext())
will only run while there is a next thing to check?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`while (<condition>)`
where `condition` is an expression that returns a `boolean` value
`str.hasNext()` returns a `boolean`
so yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what
the
fuck
why didnt you tell me this before i did the calculator<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I thought you knew lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you can put anything that results in a boolean value in a while loop's condition<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HAVE
BEEN
ENLIGHTENED
but uh
back on topic
how do i actually make a bot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're gonna need to ask ben about that one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but didnt you teach ben how to do that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
that's exactly why ben should teach you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but ben's asleep<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>let's just be clear
making a discord bot requires some OOP
so some of the stuff you'll have to do will be beyond your training
some of it was even beyond ben's<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then we must do more training
come<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck oop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>now seems like a 10/10 time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you may not fuck oop because oop fucks you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan
we must do a tutor lesson
right
fucking
now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
package wenjalan;

import net.dv8tion.jda.core.AccountType;
import net.dv8tion.jda.core.JDA;
import net.dv8tion.jda.core.JDABuilder;

public class Wendell {

    public static final boolean ENABLE_B_COMMAND = false;
    public static final String COMMAND_PREFIX = "!";

    private JDA jda;

    // main
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // check if a token was specified
        if (args.length == 0) {
            System.err.println("Please specify a bot token");
            System.exit(1);
        }

        // create a new wenjalan.Wendell
        new Wendell(args[0]);
    }

    // constructor
    public Wendell(String token) {
        init(token);
    }

    // initialization
    private void init(String token) {
        try {
            this.jda = new JDABuilder(AccountType.BOT)
                    .setToken(token)
                    .addEventListener(new ServerEventListener())
                    .addEventListener(new MessageEventListener())
                    .build();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            System.err.println("Failed login with token " + token);
            System.exit(1);
        }

        // print invite
        System.out.println("[Wendell] INVITE: " + jda.asBot().getInviteUrl());
    }

}
```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats just ur wendell bot aint it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's the head class of `Wendell` which starts the bot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wendell is the goat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`public class Wendell` defines `Wendell` as an instantiable Object<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the `main()` method accepts the bot's token (used later during initialization) as it's parameter, and creates a new instance of `Wendell`
once created, the instance of `Wendell` executes the `init()` method<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the `init()` method will initialize the `jda` object using the bot's token<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in order to build the `jda` object, we set the token using `setToken()`, add two `EventListenerAdapter`s defined in `ServerEventListener.java` and  `MessageEventListener.java`, then finally build the JDA
if the login fails, we print to console error that an error has occurred and exit
afterwards, we print out the bot's invite link, retrieved through the JDA object
<@!189852772475207680>
you get all that?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright so basically
what youre saying is
understanding OOP requires brain cells i do not have
however what i have done
is fix my calculator
so that it doesnt require the term quit at the end
much better<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in my world
we call this progress<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this level of programming is like, second or third year OOP<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ooooo
fuck
that sounds hard
also
how do i counter chinese characters
in my calculator<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>¯\_(?)_/¯<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck
import java.util.ChineseDictionary;<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>basically, if you want to make a discord bot like Ben, you're gonna need to understand at least the basics of OOP to get started<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you know what this calls for
java tutor lessons
with alan wen
but like
at a later time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you can basically ignore most of the code in Wendell if you understand that `MessageEventListener` is the important part<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
    // when a message is received in a Server text channel
    @Override
    public void onGuildMessageReceived(GuildMessageReceivedEvent e) {
        // get the message
        Message msg = e.getMessage();
        String raw = msg.getContentStripped();

        // if this message starts with the command prefix...
        if (raw.startsWith(Wendell.COMMAND_PREFIX)) {
            // ... run the command
            runCommand(msg);
        }

    }
```
so
this message is executed whenever JDA detects that a message has been sent in a server<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it retrieves the message from the `GuildMessageReceivedEvent` passed by JDA and saves it as `msg` with the actual content, in string form, stored in `raw`<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then, if the `raw` string starts with the command prefix (declared in Wendell as "!"), it runs whatever command the `msg` contains<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i understand that part
all i wanna do is just get the bot up and running
and then replace the old !b command
with an if statement
to where if someone types "eat it"
itll respond with bitch<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then you might want to have a look at starbot
lemme get him in here for you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pls dad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> how are you today
as good as ever<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> give me the succ
<@470822754262712329> .
what the fuck is this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so basically starbot is a chatbot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> whats your favorite color<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he responds to your mentions with his responses<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329>
why is he so toxic
HOW DO I MAKE A STARBOT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan made it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he's had a rough existence<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> fuck you
<@470822754262712329> fuck you
damn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ooh that's it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>solid argument<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's what you're interested in bono
the shut up/fuck you command
whenever someone says fuck you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LOL
TELL ME HOW
I MUST KNOW<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he responds no fuck you
SHUT UP<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> i will find you and hurt you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>god<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its literally just like
alan
but uncensored<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck you
fuck you
fuck you
fuck you
fuck you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> shut up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> SUCC<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's another one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
actually
its called being a comedian<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's his help command
literally a pastebin of his source<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> you're useless
<@470822754262712329> fuck
is this
all hes gonna say
<@470822754262712329>
<@470822754262712329><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no you're just getting really unlucky<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mmm
sounds like the rest of my life<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's literally a `Random` generator<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>10/10 best bot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so
where do i put the pastebin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you've hit the same response 3 times in a cache of like 100 responses
which is impressive<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> yeet
LMAO
<@470822754262712329> yeet
<@470822754262712329>
hgmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
toxic<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so basically how it works is
there's a map of key phrases it responds to and their responses
```java
            // the response entries
            map.put("lo fi", "did someone say lo fi?");
            map.put("shut up", "you shut up");
            map.put("fuck you", "no fuck you");
```
are a few
STARBOT STOP<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lo fi
lo if
lo fi<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but for your purposes, just detecting if the message.contains("eat it") will suffice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eat it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so in a nutshell<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i know how it works<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ligma<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but like
WHERE PUT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>damn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im at the discord dev portal
and i made the application
but where put<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhm
so under the "Bot" tab
create a bot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>did that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>give it a name and stuff<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>did that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then install IntelliJ<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>does it HAVE to be intellij<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>would you rather install maven, gradle, and download the JDA library all separately?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright getting it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the community edition works fine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>k wot now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>create a new gradle project<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>under GroupId put your package name
usually a company or organization
mine is `wenjalan` usually
under ArtifactId put the name of your project<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and then<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>open the project navigation pane on the left and open the `build.gradle` file<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait
what about liek
gradle jvm
and gradle home<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what
just
hit
next
what're the options
well shit
gradle home can stay empty
select Use Project JDK for Gradle JVM<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhhh
where<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>go back to the first screen
is an SDK selected under Project SDK at the top?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>intellij platform plugin SDK<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is java an option in that menu<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>select java<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>er
wauit
not on the dropdown<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then hit new
java sdk
or rather, jdk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok what now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then navigate to your jdk installation<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>found it
what now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>select the folder then try the things again
selecting java as your project sdk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok i made the project<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>open the project navigation pane and open `build.gradle`<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>build.gradle?
found it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it should be a top-level file in your project folder<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>under repositories
add `jcenter()`
```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    jcenter()
}
```
something like that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>k
did it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then under dependencies, add the JDA API
```
dependencies {
    testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'
    compile 'net.dv8tion:JDA:3.7.1_393'
}
```
the second one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>k
next<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>open the gradle tab on the right
and hit the refresh icon
at the top left of the pane<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>did it
wot now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>back in the project pane
under src/main/java
create your bot's main class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and then....
copy and paste from pastebin?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
create the public static void main method
by typing psvm
tab<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then put the line
`JDA jda;`
and see if IntelliJ has actually downloaded the JDA API<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how do i tell<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if it has, it'll alert you and offer to import it for you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it did<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>screenshot
to verify
wow you got this working a lot faster than I thought you would<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright we'll make this as non-oop as possible
change the line to<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
JDA jda = new JDABuilder(AccountType.BOT)
    .setToken(<your bot's token as a String>)
    .build();
```
do not copy and paste that
get your bot's token from the discord dev web portal under the bot tab
and uh
don't paste it to pastebin in plaintext like I did once
that's how I almost took down an entire private server<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>k i typed it
but i got security exceptiojn with .build<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>modify main() to
`public static void main(...) throws LoginException {`<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fixed
wait actually
its 11:58
i gotta go sleep before my mom gets mad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait we're almost there<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o
in that case
i shall wait<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`String invite = jda.asBot().getInviteUrl();`
print(invite)
then run<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you did everything exactly correctly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>error with print invite
its missing some stuff<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`System.out.println(invite);`
you fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it worked
i think<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>did you get an invite link?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>click on it
there
you did it
your very own bot
it's very dumb right now
but that's about as far as we'll get today
<@470822754262712329> say hi<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but
command
but<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>didn't you have to sleep<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck
gotta go fast<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fine
add one line in the jda initilization<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what are you guys doin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
JDA jda = new JDABuilder(AccountType.BOT)
    .setToken(<your bot's token as a String>)
    .addEventListener(this);
    .build();
```
making a discord bot
and make your class `extend ListenerAdapter`
`public class <ClassName> extends ListenerAdapter`
I'm trying to make Jono build a discord bot without him knowing a shred of oop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then, add the `onGuildMessageReceived` method:
```java
    // when a message is received in a Server text channel
    @Override
    public void onGuildMessageReceived(GuildMessageReceivedEvent e) {
       
    }
```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>inside that method, use `String text = e.getMessage().getContentStripped();` to retrieve the content of the message sent
check if the `text.contains("eat it")`
and if so
do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`e.getChannel().sendMessage("bitch").complete();`
and run<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>goddamn it
i went offline right as alan typed all that out
this is painful to see
that tomorrow i must
REOPEN INTELLIJ<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416>

this server is where we see alan vent his anger<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>soooo uh
whenever i type anything
the bot just pastes bitch infinitely
i think its because
it counts itself as amessage
soooo
what do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fixed it
i had an extra chromie somewhere<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@145664386021720064> Starbot doesn't have a purpose other than to sass people

the bot says something<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`e.getAuthor().getName()` returns the name of the author of this message
or something like that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but how do i format that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`String authorName = e.getAuthor().getName()`
or something<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thanks

<|start-block|>no
pls
my essay is like
1.1k words right now
dont worry about it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it'll just be 500 comments
of me dicking around<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!111635656479952896> are you srs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes

<|start-block|>TO BE FAIR<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>TO BE
OR NOT
TOBE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's 5 paragraphs
b/c the person said
"hey make this point a BTS"
and
"hey split this paragraph"

sherlock<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mine's like
740 words
only gotta cut a little<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eh
cutting 100 words or so isnt that hard
i just need to clean up some statements<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so here is a question
is inot
common knowledge
that women had a shit time in the renaissance
why do i have to find evidence
that women had a shit time in the renaissance<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's kinda like finding evidence that hitler killed himself
it's just close enough to common sense to almost pass as it
but not quite
shouldn't be that much trouble to find evidence for though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it isn't
its just that
it annoys me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just google "women during the renaissance"
and cite the first article that comes up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i did one better
i got
women in the Elizabethan era<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OOOOH
SHIIIT SON
big brain
big grades<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tho
there is a point of contention
b/c my boi WS wrote hamlet around 1601
but hamlet was performed 1609
and the elizabethan era ended 1603<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but
and stay with me on this
what if
nobody cares<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>¯\_(?)_/¯<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!111635656479952896> not 1609
1599
gotta be exact<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>are you talking about

<|start-block|>YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yea

it works out 100% of the time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I have a feeling that maybe I'll make a genuine skyline coding academy discord<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats
not a bad idea
frankly
can i make a uhhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because I see people say "longs are useless" and I start to have an aneurysm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>feels good man channel
where i just give like uh
cute animal pictures<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you see
I would
but unfortunately
I am not the owner of this server<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why not
have it be a part of the uh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that<|end-block|>

but what if
I told you
the maximum area achieved by a rectangle
is always the biggest square you can make out of that rectangle?
try it, it's true
so for 24
you can make an 8x3
wait
for a 24 unit perimeter
you can have a 3x9 rectangle
so an area of 27
you can have
an rea of
7x5
which is 35
but the maximum area
is a 6x6
36
and that's true for any rectangle
the biggest area achieved by a rectangle with a perimeter of 100
is a 25x25
= 625
a 20x30 = 600
a 10x40 = 400
but the max
is always
the square<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok so
whats the issue here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>25x25 = 625
I have a math test tomorrow and I'm struggling to study<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>isnt a square a rectangle
like
???<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
it's a rectangle
with all the sides the same length<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
so i dont see the issue here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the issue is
the problem wants you to use optimization<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>by taking the derivative of the volume equation of a rectangle
but in reality<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and you're optimizing by taking the numbers given<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>all you need to do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and making them a square<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is divide 24 by 4
and get 6<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok
nice
you found a shortcut<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
mathematics
aka
comp sci
but you do it manually
*math is just manual comp sci*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then why
am i bad at it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's like driving a car
everyone can drive an automatic without much training
but a manual
oof
math is just manual comp sci
take sigma
that's just a for loop that adds repeatedly to a sum<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sigma balls<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    sum += f(x);
} 
```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah
yes
I see
but how about<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```cpp
void main() {
    int sum = 0 + add(10);
}

int add(int amount) {
    if (amount == 0)
        return 0;
    return 1 + add(amount - 1);
}
```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>now
that's
**recursion**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Alans gone mad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why
do my pens explode
fuck me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the people in the gddc discord are a different breed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I see what you're getting at <@!111635656479952896><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what am i getting at
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they're really
really
not the sharpest knives in the box<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan
these people believed i had a child
like
me
having
a child<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it does not get more memey than me having a child<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's just
I expected more
from people who claim to be<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"game developers"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they want to develop games
not code<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the people in the help chat
they gotta know how to code
to answer a coding question
right?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean like
in theory yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay fine
I'll post the same code snippet to esports' academy
and see their reactions
if it's
"there's a better way of doing that you know"
or
"there's already an add operation in Java"
I'm kicking them<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>whats the purpose
of doing it in the first place<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's sarcastic
it's like
`String s = new String("Hello world!");`
of fucking course I know I can just use `+`
it's a JOKE you guys<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>censoring yourself
<a:angery:400076290197159936><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck you
god fucking<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>your bot is uh
less helpful
than i would expect<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wendell's the helpful one
this one just sasses people
but in its defense
it does its job
very
very
well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>can i steal the code for the bot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sure<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i need one to ping at friend of mine every 10 seconds<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the help command is just a pastebin link to the source code
I used JDA (Java Discord API) to code it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i assume
if i put it in netbeans
you will not be pleased<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you somehow manage to download the entire JDA library into netbeans and get it to compile successfully
I will not be pleased
but dumbfounded
ooh someone responded in esports
"no u"
see?
THEY FUCKING GET THE JOKE
NO I PURPOSELY BUILT
A FUCKING
RECURSIVE ALGORITHM
TO REPRODUCE THE EXACT SAME RESULTS
YOU WOULD GET FROM USING +<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk man
coding is hard
you saw the shitshow that was my tictactoe project<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I should make a follow up
hold on

WHY
WHO TAUGHT THIS BOY
AND WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>man
he has achieved true ascendancy
we should all cower in fear<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay hold on lemme write a multiplication method<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
int main() {
    int product = multiply(2, 2);
}

int multiply(int x, int y) {
    if (y == 1) {
        return x;
    }
    return x + (multiply(x, y - 1));
}
```
does that even fucking work
hold on<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes it does
okay here goes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he's gotta know that I'm just fucking with people
right?
RIGHT?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
they're going to think
you're being dead serious<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh hey
theres a bus stop near the cafe
look at that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's pretty ? if I do ? myself<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
only small issue is
if i *miss* the stop
im fucked<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well
there's always the tried and true solution
of just
not fucking up
if done correctly
works 100% of the time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>very true
i mean theres like 20 bus stops along 228th
its just anywhere between like
a 2 minute walk
or a 30 minute walk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you do manage to fuck up badly
call me and I'll rescue you<|end-block|>

the problem is
a few millennia ago
Japan stole China's alphabet

I couldn't really tell you

its like

hard to explain
```Dysgraphia is a condition that causes trouble with written expression. The term comes from the Greek words dys (“impaired”) and graphia (“making letter forms by hand”). Dysgraphia is a brain-based issue. It’s not the result of a child being lazy.

For many children with dysgraphia, just holding a pencil and organizing letters on a line is difficult. Their handwriting tends to be messy. Many struggle with spelling and putting thoughts on paper.[1] These and other writing tasks—like putting ideas into language that is organized, stored and then retrieved from memory—may all add to struggles with written expression.

Different professionals may use different terms to describe your child’s struggle with written expression. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) doesn’t use the term dysgraphia but uses the phrase “an impairment in written expression” under the category of “specific learning disorder.” This is the term used by most doctors and psychologists.

Some school psychologists and teachers use the term dysgraphia as a type of shorthand to mean “a disorder in written expression.”

To qualify for special education services, a child must have an issue named or described in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). While IDEA doesn’t use the term “dysgraphia,” it describes it under the category of “specific learning disability.” This includes issues with understanding or using language (spoken or written) that make it difficult to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell or to do mathematical calculations.

Whatever definition is used, it’s important to understand that slow or sloppy writing isn’t necessarily a sign that your child isn’t trying hard enough. Writing requires a complex set of fine motor and language processing skills. For kids with dysgraphia, the writing process is harder and slower. Without help, a child with dysgraphia may have a difficult time in school.```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"affects handwriting:"
your handwriting is good though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?
are you
retart<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>have you seen mine
mine is worse
maybe i have dysgraphia<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes nic
because i went to a therapist
for 6 years
to fix my handwriting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a therapist?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
speech therapist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>boy, you needed a strict chinese teacher<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have spent 0 years trying to improve my handwriting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they do writing too apparently<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"write this sentence 100 times"
as a warmup
and they wonder why I developed early onset arthritis<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oof<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay not really
but arthritis does run in my family
and my wrists are super worn
like
my hand starts to hurt if I write more than a page of notes
aka the sacrifices I make to type at 100 wpm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mm
my handwriting just gets sloppy with prolonged usage
cant wait
for those ib tests<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you've seen my handwriting
it's been described as
drunk cursive<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>have i seen your handwriting?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so imagine a signature
but make an entire font out of that
that's basically it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>arthritis runs in my family too alan
ive done barely any of my hw and i want to go to bed early today
cause i have sat on saturday<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OH SHIT
FUCK EVERYTHING ELSE
JUST GO TO SLEEP
like
right now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no

```Back to the top
What can be done at home for dysgraphia?
There are many things you can do at home to help your child with dysgraphia. Here are some strategies to consider.

Observe and take notes. Taking notes about your child’s writing difficulties (including when they occur) will help you find patterns and triggers. Then you can develop strategies to work around them. Your notes will also be useful when you talk to your child’s doctor, teachers and anyone else helping your child.
Teach your child writing warm-up exercises. Before writing (or even as a break when writing), your child can do a stress-reliever exercise. He could shake his hands quickly or rub them together to relieve tension.
Play games that strengthen motor skills. Playing with clay can strengthen hand muscles. A squeeze ball can improve hand and wrist muscles and coordination.```
i did shit like that with my therapist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what if
you just typed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ha
ha
ha
you'd be surprised
how hard it is to convince teachers
to let you type assignments<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>was "I have a diagnosable medical condition" not enough?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
ISD doesn't recognize it as an issue for the most part
it'd have to be so severe to the point where you cannot write at all
but since i *can* write i dont get shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well
fuck
<@470822754262712329> ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean like

<|start-block|>did you like it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we need group therapy sessions at skyline where everyone just rants about the ib<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
i was in a grade of 13 kids right
4 guys 9 girls
now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a lot of people at  our school need therapy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>basically
the group therapy time was
me and someone i disliked would be sent to the office and put into a room
to talk about our problems
and then the rest of them
sat down and talked about their feelings of being excluded
or how they weren't immediately invited to everything the class did
or complaining that the dating policy was dumb<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>excuse me

where you weren't allowed to date people unless your class had a 50/50 split

<|start-block|>alan stahp<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you've won your own free pass
To be out guest
If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Life is so unnerving
For a servant who's not serving
He's not whole without a soul to wait upon
Ah, those good old days when we were useful
Suddenly those good old days are gone
Ten years we've been rusting
Needing so much more than dusting
Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills
Most days we just lay around the castle
Flabby, fat and lazy
You walked in and oops-a-daisy!
It's a guest
It's a guest
Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert
She'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft shoeing
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing
I'll get warm
Piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up! We want the company impressed
We've got a lot to do
Is it one lump or two
For you, our guest
She's our guest
She's our guest
She's our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Our command is your request
It's ten years since we had anybody here
And we're obsessed
With your meal
With your ease
Yes, indeed, we aim to please
While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you
We'll keep going
Course by course
One by one
'Til you shout, enough, I'm done
Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest
Tonight you'll prop your feet up
But for now, let's eat up
Be our guest
Be our guest
Be our guest
Please, be our guest

<|start-block|>my math IA is being frustrate
its making me a sad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sounds like fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why did me adding a scalar to a cubic function turn it into a graph of x=0?
wtf desmos<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>desmos just doesnt like my fucking equation
my graphing calculator does it fune
fine
this is gay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Fuck you thats why
Fuck off starbot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont remember how to do piecewise on my graphing calculator
so i cant see it the way i wanna see it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Also we are doing brunch monday and wednesday?
Or just Monday?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im all for monday
idk about wednesday
mayyyyybe<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>but im not hundo por santo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Idk either, i figure im going to be at the school from 1010 anyways
So like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont see why desmos cant graph
\left(\frac{27}{1000}\right)\ \left(-\frac{x^3}{3}+6x^2-11x\right)+\frac{2875}{1053}<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Idk man<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
what
the flying fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```desmos
\left(\frac{27}{1000}\right)\ \left(-\frac{x^3}{3}+6x^2-11x\right)+\frac{2875}{1053}
```
aww it didnt work
desmos isnt a language
it cant graph this
but it graphs this just fine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Idk man
I dont math<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait
apparently if i graph it as y= whatever
it works
if i graph it as e(x)=
it breaks
wtf<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i didnt know desmos was so fucking picky<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>You will do what desmos tells you
And you will enjoy it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont wanna graph it as f(x)
that ruins my alohabet

<|start-block|>Sometimes covers go horribly horribly wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i like jojo siwa<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just listen to songs without lyrics
then thats never a problem<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya but then you miss

questionable<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i already hate humble

the contrast between heavy/light vocals is interesting i guess
never thought i'd hear someone scream stretch marks
but here we are<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the lyrics are so out of place LOL
you're right about the contrast<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this one is actually pretty good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if the lyrics didnt feel so out of place i would like this version of humble better
like i like the style i just dont like the song lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao
ya oln does weird things
theyre like a melodic metalcore band
but rock
which hurts my head sometimes<|end-block|>

and while their selection isn't really anything to brag about
what I've been served has been decent<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont remember too well since it was some time ago but the noodles were hella soggy (overcooked) the broth was really wack and the chashu... subpar
ive only tried their ramen tho

<|start-block|>yeah you were like
finna go to bed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but i need to re-spread falgsc so <:FeelsBadMan:352976311813406721><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>of all my classes this year
Chinese has been the one I'm struggling in the most
grade-wise
and that
makes me
pertubed
but that's not counting Calc 2
whose last test
was kind of a ravage
and it's the first test
that goes in
and tests are worth<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>80%<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>over 80% of my grade
**over**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah my grade in math is
yeah
my grade in math is not something to brag about<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>**telling just tell me my score so I can retake it already**
but it
's just tho
se two cla
sses
chinese
and
calculus
WHY
**IB ENGLISH 12 WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE HARD ONE**
(boas is just too nice, that's why)
but
**JIANG LAOSHI PLEAAAAAAASE**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I might need to start studying for chinese now
and the thought of that makes me queasy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but comp sci is going strong at a 100%
so I have that, at least<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i still have a 100% in bio<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>maybe I should just study extra chinese
while in health
jesus christ
i know yall already took health
but taking health as a senior
is like
taking a middle school class about making "good choices"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol chinese
im also reaching the extent of my chinese dictionary<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I got a 75 on the food project
like
what
how<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what happened<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i got a 90<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I got an 87 on the last test
which I mean
sure
makes sense
but<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>quiz or test<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*test*
was it just me
or was it a lot longer
than previous tests
or was it because
there was a whole bunch of review shit
that I completely threw out the window over the summer
either way<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it was much longer
im group w<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm sitting in this class with an 88<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and i literally
W R O T E<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and
by now you know the way grades work<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o i got a 94.5
on the test
its all about knowing FOOD
EAT
WATCH
BOOK<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's starting to, "set"
my grade is
like concrete
easy to change early
hard to change after a little while
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my uh
block grade and math grade
are starting to set<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>chinese has literally twice the number of assignments than any other of my classes
why<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>taking health
in general
is a meme
so
like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"ALRIGHT GUYS, TODAY WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>are you really implying
that you would've taken it seriously<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey guys<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"REMEMBER TO WRITE YOUR NAME AT THE TOP OF YOUR PAPER"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>as a freshman<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dont fuck people<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so they get preguntes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>before youre ready<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck that
fuck everyone
have children<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HEY GUYS
IF YOURE A VIRGIN
YOURE GAY
LOLOLOLOL<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"OKAY GUYS, ANSWER THE DAILY QUESTION ON THE WHITEBOARD"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait dont fuck people<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how many tests are we given in an average semester in chinese
I gotta start doing the calculations if I wanna bring my grade back<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk
like
6
also
parker has anti cheating measures right
for comp sci tests/quizzes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's parker
he has *programs* that check<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bruh
sakthikumar
doesnt have anti cheating
literally
class average
30/44
40% of the class copied and pasted from someone who got 97%
i better see some of those anti cheating measures in place
or im gonna fucking kill someone
no screen watcher
no code checker
no nothing
she literally sits at her computer
and just D O E S N T
do
anything<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tbf, that's basically what parker does
but mostly because he has programs that do all those things for him
like
he has two monitors, correct?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but thats the thing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>one of them always has everyone's screens on it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>parker is smart
he already made that
but sakthikumar
ooo ooo aa aaa
literally
code is COPIED
AND
PASTED
AND SHE DOESNT SEE IT
COME ON<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look if people are scoring 30/44 even with *copying* I think there's bigger problems at play<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THATS
WHAT
IM
TRYING
TO
EMPHASIZE
IF THEY DIDNT CHEAT
OUR CLASS AVERAGE WOULD BE A FUCKING HARD F
it just makes me so fucking mad
that stupid people
can do stupid shit
and still get away with it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sitting in on an SL class this year<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>by being stupid<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>basically everyone is gonna retake their first test
so I hear<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im retaking too
but like
why am I still above the average with cheaters
thats not a good thing
because i literally went retard mode on the test<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you want someone to beat
my highest ever test score was a 130%<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how the fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>on the semester 2 final<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o
watch and learn
im coming in hot
also
today
i taught zak how to make bot
i am passing on the knowledeg
using the ancient technique of "i have no idea what the fuck oop is"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look
we can start oop
uuuuuuuhhhh
hold on
once SL finishes arrays
by then, you'll have done mostly everything you absolutely need to have down twice
and I'll start you on OOP
and just as a warning
OOP has made people *quit* comp sci<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you should really be familiar with non-oop concepts before diving in<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fucking chinese
my project and test categories are at 83 and 88 respectively
so it's not like I
've been throwing
but just haven't been *not* throwing well enough
doesn't help that Jiang Laoshi is docked me 2 points of participation on the first week
like what the fuck
okay doing the math
projects will be fine since I got 100/100 culture points for volunteering at salmon days
which'll save that ezpz
for tests
just
like
do well on the quizzes
do well enough on the tests
and it'll level out
fuck
ing

<|start-block|>You're not wrong
My life has gone downhill ever since reactivating Facebook<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in Java
the compiler will tell you when you've entered an index outside the range of the array you're indexing
trying to access index 10 of an array with a length of 3 with give you an IndexOutofBoundsException
but in C++
it'll just keep reading whatever the hell the next block of memory is
so accessing index 10 of an array with a length of 3
returns whatever value of memory was stored roughly 7 blocks past the end of the array's allocated memory space
it could be another variable
random garbage
another program's data
who knows
this has been Learning C++ with Alan

how many essays
have you done<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*one*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>are a lot of people still procrastonating<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>better than me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that you know of<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the personal statement for UW<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my parents are *convinced*
i need to go to a great books school<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay so there is a flight for $822 around the same time as the first one
but it's three times longer
35h 30m
stops in hawaii
alaska
and canada<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ha
ha
ha
ha
nop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I've always wanted to live in an airplane<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>all the flights average around $1070
and by average
I mean a vast majority of the flights are exactly $1070
for a two-week trip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ive written my
"personal statment" for the second itme
it's being edited
and i wrote the diversity one
and half of my ut austin one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I've written my personal statement
7 and a half times
that's what you get if UW is your first choice
also
there's a flight for about $900
but that leaves in late-june and returns early august
but then again, this is senior summer, so it's like a month longer than a usual summer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>buddy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why 7 and a half times
what the fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how long do you wanna be in japan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan what the fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>holy fuck dude<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>was aiming for 2 weeks
plus two or so to make up for airplane time
and timezone difference
and break days
and shopping
so really<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and
and
adn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>try two-three weeks at most
1 week aint enough<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i
hmm
wouldnt we want to be able to speak *some* japanese<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>don't worry, I'll learn japanese in a week<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i
hmm
what if you made starbot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>act as a translator<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>answer my question
why 7 and a half times
wtf<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because
UW<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WHAT DOES THAT MENA<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it means<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he wants to get into UW<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>well actually this is like my 3rd time
if i count that one shit time
over summer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what if we
like
went
for an undisclosed amount of time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how bout we go somewhere cheaper
international flying is gonna be expensive no matter what
so gues what that means
staying in the statse<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>CHINA<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh my lord
16 hours flight
please<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>??<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what if we like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait

<|start-block|>did a road trip
to nyc?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ROAD TRIP
YES
YES<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>COUNTRY ROOAAAAAAADS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not to NYC but somewhere else<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>boston?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>MY HOMETOWN
no im kidding<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
im not going into the south<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because
im racist
ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the greater houston area is like one of the few liberal parts of texas
sorry<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not of texas<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so i'll be shot by a liberal
<:POGGERS:493550630913310725><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THE SOUTH
are you actualyl racist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i am too
it's ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im also apaprently an sjw
and a nazi
and a communist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're not an sjw
but those other two yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and occasionally a feminist
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i hate my own race
like my dad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay but fr I've been eyeing a trip to japan for a while now
financing is the biggest obstacle, I'll agree<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>roooad triiiiip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok
lets assume for a second<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>are you implying we take a road trip to japan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>financing isn't an issue<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean yes
according to iggy azalea<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the UNITED STATES
we could go to BOYSTON idc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there is a highway from LA to tokyo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ew LA
i dont want to touch califonia again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya well
it doesnt wanna touch you either<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that god damn $822 flight keeps showing up
yes I know it's cheaper
but
32h
is a LONG FUCKING TIME<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>raiding hours of top wow guilds
10/10<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is this your job you spoke about<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
i look at data and tell people they're dumb<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and then get paid<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a data scientist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if the people paying me
feel like
fucking paying me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so far the most appealing flights in terms of cost, dates, and time is an Alaska/Singapore Airlines 15-day venture for $1070
which is, by summertime international flights
"pretty average"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but if we
uh
don't care that we skip graduation
there's a $792 available<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you know
i could probably convince my parents that graduation isn't worth it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nevermind
that one's 56 hours long<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>buddy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you ever just wanna fuckin camp in a plane
for like
half a week<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you ever just wanna
fucking die
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o ya
do i wear my hawaiian shirt tomorrow
yes no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>y e s<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>now the real question is
do i just wear the hawaiian shirt
and then act completely normal otherwise
i think yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>flights drop to around the $900 mark around late july
we could do a road trip late june and hit japan late july
if we REALLY REALLY wanna yeet the shit outta this summer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this is a lot of yeeting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>remember to preyeet your oven to 420 degrees ? kids<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>stop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I keep typing
fornite
out of habit
for (nite)
that's why<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so let's say a ticket costs $1000
if we get medium spendy hotels
that like
$100 a day for all of us
soooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>$25 a person per se<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmm
but thats not including like
food<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im getting to that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>transportation
get to it faster<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OKAY OKAY
transportation
getting a japanese rail pass is probably the most ideal way to get around
for 14 days
is 46,390 yen
like $400
aka
$28 bucks a day
plus say
i dunno
$100 a day for food
that's probably way too much
but whatever<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>100 day
what in the fuck
kind of food are you getting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*classy* food
idfk
then say
$100 more for daily activities or whatever
shopping
~~extra $100 for figurines~~
comes out to like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>$1000 + $400 + $225(14)
$4,550
grossly overestimated
so like
absolute maximum
we could possibly spend<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so basically what you're saying is
wen eed like
4.5k a person<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if we fuck up, yes
it's probably more around $3000
because imagine spending $200 a day on food and activities<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok but like
i think itd be better if we plan for the worse?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sure
go $10k<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jesus
what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>let's just fucking rent an apartment in japan for like a month
okay doing the math again with realistic numbers
so like
$100 a day for food AND activities
$3,150
yeah okay
that sounds a lot more realistic<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ideally, we'd aim for $3,000
and have a safety net of $4,000
and a "you fucked up" net of $5,000
the "you fucked up" net including costs attributed to
medical treatment
emergency funds
shit we forgot something important
we suddenly won the lottery
one of us got a huge scholarship from some university and now have several thousand dollars to spend
~~anime figurines~~
and lastly
egregious amounts of food
wait
and also
a
"I need to fly back to the US immediately for an emergency"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean uh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cost<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bellarmine is offering me like 20k i think?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cool, japan trip's on jason

<|start-block|>"The Back Alley in Chinatown" was first conceived and composed at around 7:43 PM on October 16th, 2018 and finished production on 8:15 PM on October 16th, 2018 by self-proclaimed Underground Asian Hip-Hop Artist Alan "Doc Wenton" Wen. In it, Wen samples the likes of a timpani drum and a cowbell for a taiko drum and ceremonial bell respectively, symbolizing the "white-washing" of Asian culture in America. "I never intended the song to blow up like it did," Wen states in an interview. "But once I got feedback from Jared and Jose, it just got so much more popular." Wen went on to publish two more songs the following week, "Dim Sum Win Some", and "Trouble Brews in Little Tokyo". Both of which received critical acclaim from the two Discord servers where he published the songs.<|end-block|>

<|start-block|><@!111635656479952896> why was your homecoming "something"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>had some personal stuff overlap it
made it sorta hard to enjoy everything that was happening<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i see<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>indeed
but do you look<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>at what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do you look<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do i look?
i-i dont know<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>does thou
looketh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i do
i guess\<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Good.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so
the sorting race
I beat Parker again today with a time of 0.35
but two more challengers approach
and they're fucking
Daniel C. and Vishal D.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok so
have you considered<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>both with times under 0.3<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you make the first bit of the numbers sorted
and the last bit
and dont care about the middle<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what happens if you have
`[100, 111, 101]`<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see
what if we consider this
its a set list of numbers
therefore the highest will always be the same
as well as the lowest
so you already know the say, bottom 10 and top 10<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there's duplicates
I rewrote my entire program again
and now my time is a 0.37 on this computer
meaning
somewhere in the neighborhood of a 0.25-0.30 on the school's computers
possibly better<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you mean daniel cheng and mr. devireddy?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yup<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I coulda sworn one of em used gameshark
but their times were verified by parker
so I guess I just gotta keep shaving off milliseconds<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>to shave milliseconds
one must first shave themselves<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey alan

<|start-block|>"If I could give Mr. Cook zero stars, I would. Going into my freshman year of highschool, Orchestra was one of my favorite classes in middle school, but this class ruined Orchestra for me. Mr. Cook knows absolutely nothing of musical instruments, and has the technique of an elementary school player. In addition to his utter failure in playing instruments, he also has a horrible attitude towards the students. Please dodge a bullet and don’t make the decision I did to take his class. "<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Mr. Cook's class. The technique is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Cook's attractivenes most of the jokes will go over a typical listener's head. There’s also Mr. Cook's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Beethoven, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these pieces. "<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im kidding
oh my
meme one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what are these copy pastas<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"Mr. Cook is the greatest teacher I've ever had and will have in my life. He taught me all I knew about vibrato and playing beautiful music on my violin. His violin skills are better than Joshua Bell's; his vibrato is so lush and vibrant that it makes flowers bloom, and the birds sing in praise. All the teachers bow to his majesty as he strolls regally down the hallways of Skyline. Join the Skyline Orchestra and bask in the radiant glory of the Great Conductor, Mr. Darrin Cook. "
"My daughter was in his class, and will be next year as well. She always came home complaining about how bad his teaching and musical skills were. I thought that was an exaggeration, until I helped chaperone one of the concerts that the kids had to go to. "Wow" was my only impression. While observing them warm up and rehearse, I realized that everything that my daughter said was completely true. It was clear that this man had no business being a teacher, orchestra or not. "
"easily the easiest class i have ever taken, no homework and no tests, also a huge pushover, this class is a joke and an easy A"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there are "test"
"tests"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dude<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>his rating is a 3.2 of 5<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sws orchestra was cutthroat
well
it wouldve been<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mostly because of meme reviews<|end-block|>

Ciustea has a 2.33
with 1 rating
"I had Ciustea for gen physics in her first year at Skyline. Normally I try to be understanding of first year teachers and their struggles but I honestly couldn't with her. she doesn't know how to explain concepts, mainly teaches through videos (which are confusing), and does nothing to help confused students (aka the whole class). the only upside is you don't have to work hard for a good grade because she doesn't know how to use skyward and forgets to check homework all the time. "<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this is
very true
very accurate<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how would I write a review for Cook<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"It's as if the administration decided, 'What if we chose someone wholly unqualified to play in an orchestra, let alone direct one, teach the orchestra class?'"
would you say that's fair <@!145664386021720064><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>too harsh but it's true<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i really should
finish this outline
but
thats a lot of work<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean the administration gave the notion they dont believe in student's ability when they sent that admin to give us that shitty pep talk
so i guess
they trash us so trash them<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Jiang Laoshi has a rating of 4.83
with two reviews
"She is probably one of my favorite teachers. She does have a Chinese Accent, but after a while you get used to it :). She is extremely helpful and interactive in her class, and loves to help us if we need help. She is an amazing Chinese Teacher and I would definitely recommend her to other classmates :). "<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>google translate tthe class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and a slightly shorter one
"easier than ur mom "<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean
for chinese one
true<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the reviews for Haldeman, the Japanese teacher, are kinda scary
"Her teaching style is very exclusive, and she will not stop for the students who struggle. She won't even allow the more proficient students to help the stragglers. I am even beginning to suspect she is psychopathic. She has brought students to tears several times and has never shown a single drop of emotion or sympathy, acting as if they are at fault for distracting the class with their crying and only acknowledges them to ask them to leave the classroom for the duration of their crying."<|end-block|>

fucking
doran
with the
4.9
ez ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if I were to write a review for Doran
it would be like
"I used to hate history class."
"Then I took Doran's class."
"I now love history class."<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how tf you hate history class
fuck off<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>starbot suck my wriggly dick<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you were in on level history
for years 1-9<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
on level<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then immediately took doran's class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for history/la
is shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the contrast would be astounding<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why the hell you take on level in 9th<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because on level is where they tell you that muslims are inherently evil b/c salman rushdie said so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you couldve had mr. steen or mr. pannanen
both were good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cuz I wasn't in honors in 8th and humanities wasn't my best subject<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tbf
im on level for math<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but then I took 10th honors with doran matheny<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but thats math
and math is bad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and now I'm in IB 12 English
matheny doran might sound like a legend jason<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im on level for math too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but trust me
it's real<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its' ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>honors math isn't much to brag about<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see but you see
i dislike block classes
i already dont want to speak when a class of 30 kids divides into 2<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's just because they got extra instruction in like 5th grade when math boxes were still a thing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i really dont wanna speak when half the class means 30 kids<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont think ib 11th should be block
too chaotic
should be like 12th grade<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok let me put it this way <@!478706068223164416><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>split<|end-block|>

forced you to use the lattuce method

<|start-block|>that sounds
wholly inefficient<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
no shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you ever consider just
learning math on your own
for fun?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats
effectively what i did
we also didnt get calculators until highschool
which mean if you had some large ass multiplication to do
you did that shit with a pencil
or occasionally chalk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>boy I don
't even remember how to multiply by hand anymore
I just kinda foil everything out
325 * 199
=
(300 + 20 + 5) * (200 - 1)
because fuck if I remember how to set up a multiplaction problem any more
but I do know
calculus
and that way, I can use calculus
or at least algebra<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see but like
why not do
325 x 2 x 100 - 325<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>4-6 PAGE ESSAY<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>PERSPECTIVE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LETS GO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>paper 3 is ez
english is actually harder
somehow<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>depends on the unit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>english *can* be easier because you can basically never be wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>huck/gatsby/crucible was crisp<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>CIVIL WAR<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>other shit was hard<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok the only hard paper 3 for me was civil war
civil war is kind ahard<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OH LOOK<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you dont study<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ITS THE CIVIL WAR UNIT TOO
uhhh
basically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok well study your ass off<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>causes of civil war
westward expansion<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"slavery?"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>compromise of 1850
slavery
yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>causes of civil war: slavery<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then the south is like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yee haw<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"what the fuck north you dont follow our rules but you get mad when we dont follow yours"
so then they all secede when lincoln wins 1860
because theyre like "slavery is fucked"
then the union is like
hold on sport lemme just have a civil war with you rq
but because we have more resources and more everything
unless you win in two seconds youre fucked
oh look you didnt win in two seconds<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean
the union<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>go make a shitty justification for yourself called the lost causes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>was getting fucked for the first part of it<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>thats still important
cause
CHANGE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>grant like

but then sherman burns the fuck out of the south
during his march
like he salts the fields<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and burns the towns<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>@bon https://docs.google.com/document/d/1arxJok_cP1L2H6flLc5S5MYaU4HvWRkhx4XY6qQ9Ey0/edit?usp=sharing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so then the dudes are fucked<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>have fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ty
reconstruction is like
ok guys well the south is autistic
but lincoln is like
guys lets be nice
10% of people have to say ok im a union dude now
then they get state legislature
but radical republican congress was like
YOU STUPID
and then lincoln died from being bang bang in head<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>BANG BANG<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then johnson comes in and everyone is like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THE SOUND OF THE DRUM<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this guy is fucking retarded
so radical republicans try to do shit like guarantee rights
but then johnson is like
NOH
but congress overrules it
then basically everyone fucking hates johnson and tries to impeach him because hes a southern democrat
against a radical republican northern congress
then grant gets elected
but grant sucks dick at managing economy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so then the KKK rises because why the fuck not<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what goes wrong
when electing generals

<|start-block|>and then grant DEFLATES THE VALUE OF GOLD<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><:thonk:493553530700038144><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and then he gets relected some how<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>literally how hitler got elected???<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but hes like nah fuck this im out<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>so you could really pull anything to show your character<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but i stil cant think of shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk man
it could literally be as small as like
going out of your way to help someone
something that feels natural for you to do but others might not
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>right
either way i'd be hard pressed to think of something i could ramble about for 500 words
and i dont want it to just encapsulate an aspect of my charcter but like
who i am
what is my most defining moment
and that just
breaks my brain<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>¯\_(?)_/¯
did you ever have like
a really difficult choice you had to make ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fucking no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok so you can say you're decisive
or good under pressure<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
its that ive never been forced to make difficult decisions
at least not afaicr<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you have never had to make a difficult decision
ever<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>as far as i can remember, no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>maybe im just too "go with the flow" or "day to day" so once its done i just leave it at that and dont think about it anymore
if i feel its complete, then its done-zo
gone
ini
fini*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok so you're good at getting things done
and moving from task to task<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>am i though?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well idfk fran its your life<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i guess you're not wrong actually
you're not *too* wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>maybe talk about a time you had a lot to do and it was very stressful?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like, n o w ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but you were able to prioritize and complete the tasks with efficiency
i mean like
you *could*
that doesnt sound like the best idea, but you *could*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>honestly i dont have much i just *d o n t k n o w h o w t o g o a b o u t i t*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well why dont you answer a different question then?
what about 3 ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im explaining how i dont defining moments in my life
and you expect me to remember
when some shitfuck belief of mine was called into question?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not called into question
challenged
think of socratic seminars<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>same difference<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>has anyone said something that didnt sit well with you?
no
not the same difference
challenging a belief is trying to prove it wrong
calling your belief into question would be trying to see if you're willing to stand by it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mm
i see them as two sides of the same coin but nyeh
either way it's probably not my best bet
btw are you applying to UW?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eh
maybe
probably not<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well you gotta decide on that maybe real fucking soon<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yea i know lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause if you decide you want to
yknow wassup<|end-block|>

<|start-block|><@!110137446053736448> here you go<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>good so far, but focus more on what makes you unique compared to everyone else<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!189852772475207680> revise this for me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>democrats lost a seat in the senate <:catblob:461594251378294784><|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> i would talk more about like
maybe esports went through a dark time
like
"it seemed rough but with enough effort and dedication, the club became a thriving place of over 130 members"
right now it just seems like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>when we didnt have a consistent advisor<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a cool place<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and alan took
a vacation?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you dont really talk about YOU
you just say "yeah I did things"
and then bam wow esports<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I started off in draft 1 doing that, but I got feedback that I should focus on what I got out of the experience rather than focusing on the club's story
thus, esports is now a fairy tale<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so according to the prompt
your answer is
i come from a background where teamwork makes the dream work<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes essentially<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and that you will contribute to that team
at UW<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>exactly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>note how I didn't mention that our club base is made in extreme majority of males<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you dont need the first part of the 2nd paragraph<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tenks aln<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"My title may have been secretary, but..."
you could just say
I wanted to make Skyline eSports more than just another club at skyline<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*snip*
okay what else<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ehhhhh
personal opinion
but i think you say competitive gaming a LITTLE too much
"a place where students from any background could find others that held their same passion: an interest in the world of competitive gaming.
"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!110137446053736448> if you can get back to me on my uw essay by sunday that'd be great<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats paragraph 2<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>since I'm planning to submit on sunday<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"Everyone who joined the club had one thing in common: a passion for competitive gaming"
thats paragraph 4
You could probably say
something about how competitive gaming brought everyone together
rather than everyone who came together liked competitive gaming
like...<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I like it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"Everyone's passion for competitive gaming created a sense of community..."
im not you so you word it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"A shared love for eSports brought together a community..."<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
i like competitive gaming more
because low and behold
*UW likes competition now*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uw has esports teams<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>@ pubg<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they probably know what esports is<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>@ declen oberst
dude
UW is super competitive
in esports
theyre like 2nd in the nation
or some shit
for pubg<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>imagine if I became an executive of the esports organization at uw<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>s t o p<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that'd be hilarious<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jesus
people are winning seats by like
56% of the vote
damn lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!111635656479952896> are you discussing the election here because politics are banned in every other discord?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mildly
that and my friend isnt back from driving class yet
once hes here ill stop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>keep going<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tbf i *could* go talk about it in WCP<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it makes for a good way to stay updated
at a glance<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just need to be entirely liberal 100% of the time
ok
well so far democrats are up 6 in the house
republicans are up 1 in the senate
democrats are also up 2 in governors<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>IN is the seat that flipped for the senate btw<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>where are you on the politcal spectrum
<@!111635656479952896><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh
i have a political compass saved somwhere
about there
but i feel the questions are dumb
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
im on the other side<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well its sorta like uh
whats it called
the abortion one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pro choice
pro life
???<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like ideally we'd only need it in very few situations
cause with enough birth control options that are cheap you have no real reason to
especially if they're 100% effective
its just that neither of those are true as of right now
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I don't know where I'd place on the spectrum
my mission statement is<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there ya go
im not really surprised at where i placed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"For the betterment of humanity"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that is very general
and not really partisan
my mission statement is "we used to run with the wolves"
so
what the fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I like to label myself "humanitarian" if that means anything<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i
what the fuck does that mean
you want to better humanity ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we should aim to improve the quality of life for as many people as possible<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan
that
doesnt really give anything<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>give me an issue<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>same sex marriage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>let the gays marry because that makes more people happy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what if the majority of the population opposes same sex marriage?
then wouldn't the option that keeps the most people happy banning same sex marriage?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the gays get to be more happy than the opposing people are angry
therefore
total happiness increased<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i
that depends on your ratio of gay people to straight people
but sure<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>abortion
pro-choice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>um<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jonathan is a communist
ban him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because **quality** of life goes down in situations where pregnancy is unwanted
for both the child and mother
therefore
less people sad
more people happy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you're just focused on quality of life<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im also pro abortion<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>as opposed to anything else<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if the mom doesnt want it they dont want it
you cant flame em if theyre trying to painlessly pervent their child from dynig<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>quality of life<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for as many people as possible<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ACO won NY14 at 78% of the vote
holy shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"People with serious inheritable disabilities should not be allowed to reproduce."
this is where my statement falls apart<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see for me
that depends on the disability<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>on one hand, you decrease the QOL of the subject at hand if you disallow it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and even then that feels really fucking invasive for the government to be mandating<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>on the other hand, allowing it could cause a decrease in QOL for the child that inherits the disease<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well that depends
if its a disability that could be treated by medication it could be just fine
as long as they're on the meds and have the money for it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
therefore<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you can't, then it creates issues<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it should be allowed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and if its untreatable by medication then it creates issues as well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but extensive research should be put into curing such diseases<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye
but that raises the question of is it okay for them to reproduce if you're searching for a cure<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>find the cure faster<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>democrats up 11 seats in the house btw
still down 1 in the senate
about 5 tossups for senate left
2 LD 1 leanR and 1 LR left<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i said yes to disabled people reproducing because evolution works in weird ways
also
idk how to feel
i agree some of the questions were interpretably worded
like you could take agree and disagree as meaning the same thing depending on how you tackle the question
therefore making the question kinda bad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh shit alan and i are pretty much the same
im more of a libtard though
and a little less communist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but again, all my choices boil down to what will increase the overall quality of life the most<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just answered with what felt right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gut reaction to some degree<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean thats what you should be doing tbh
like sure obviously some questions could have answers that you disagree with<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>on a few questions i would've appreciated a neutral<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i would've appreciated a uh
"Depends on x" for a lot of them
like is it ok to break international law<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>l o l im politically negative<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but i understand that when neutral's an option theres a tendency to choose it for everything<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>neutral<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>depends on why we're breaking it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it said "in some situations breaking international political law is justified"
im guessing the degree of your agreeing
is implicative of how often you feel its applicable<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my agreement to that hinges on what they're doing
like are you about to launch a nuke?
yeah fuck it burn it down<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is it like
a human rights violation ?
probably not, but maybe
cause you can use the UN and other shit to stop that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*human right to not be disintegrated or a victim of generations of genetic radioactive mutation*
*and other related health damages*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk man
i'd kinda like a third arm
tbh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>chances are you'd get a third

recounts?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>would've been an A+ meme to see MS go dem
nah its like
the top 2 voters get a second election
and thats who gets the seat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hm
weird<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>b/c right now
they have 2 republican and 2 democrat canidates
basically it means they'll prolly go republican
cause the 17 and 40% republican canidates are combined<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how do they get 4 candidates?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>as opposed to the 40% and 1% of democrats<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is there not some rule against this?
some kinda lead-up elections per party?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not that im aware of<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>or is it just people going " i wanna be in congress" and the aligning themselves<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>usually candidates are selected by the parties
but sometimes parties just dont
cause its not worth the issue<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ohh
apparently Thrad Cochran was going to have the seat until 2021 ye
but he said he had to quit
so this is a special election where 4 candidates go onto the ballot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so they're electing 2 people?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and then if no candidate has the majority (50%+) then they do another election
yes and no
there are two elections taking place<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gotcha?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>one is decided
the other one is this special election<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeet fam<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that'll happen the 27th<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cant not listen to the best song ever
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its on my chill playlist
and came on
so...<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>democrats up 17 seats in the house now
up apparently missed the memo of wanting to be up 2 seats in the senate
and republicans are up by 2 in the senate
<:catblob:461594251378294784><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but which is more important?
please answer i dont know.
senate right?
or are they ***e q u a l ***<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>both are equally important
senate does certain things house can't iirc
but they both need to agree to pass legislation
meaning if house becomes democrat majority they can stop a lot of shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the senate does the ***impeachment trial***<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mhmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but we need house to start it for that to matter<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HoR is also representative of population
senate is equal opinion<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>***o o f***<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the idea is that house is interest of the people
and senate is interest of the state<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's the idea
who knows what it is in practice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>house is elected every 2 years
senate every 6
senators have to appeal to an entire state
meaning radical opinions do better in the house<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ACO is a good representation of that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>acorn?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
social democrat in NY14
she won by like
67% of the vote
lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>muhgawd
by or with?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>by
with like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>muhgawd<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>80%<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i can do the mental math<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>13% rep and 7% independent
anyways
senate does like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i should be personally statementing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>approval of treaties<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but i think this is also important<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>house does uh
"bills of appropriation"
aka shit that means money
house decides president in a tie
senate decides VP in a tie<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but yeah democrats having one or the other means they'd be able to block trump on a lot of things
getting control of both means a lot of shit wont happen<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tbf even if democrats got their majority in senate and house
im pretty sure you need 2/3s to impeach
which they wont<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>correct
i think
im not saying it would happen
just reviewing my US government facts
cause i dont remember shit about the US
because like i answered in the quiz
giving a shit about specific nation is dumb
nationalism is big retardo
and i dont care about america
and how it works
cause im also big retardo
you see i swing too far to the other side<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eh
nationalism isn't inherently bad
its just often used for bad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the spectrum between negatice nationalism and total apathy
im too close to being totally apathetic<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> any way to get starbot to yell "get out" at people who are playing fortnite?

KS NM MI for governors
which means gerrymandering
<:LUL:301798789818220544><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>POGGERS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>speshul<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jason you enjoying the chill beets<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh more gerrymandering
i love gerrymandering<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
but my friend is now online
so imma go talk to him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i still dont really understand how gerrymandering works
i get the general concep
i understand how it sways votes and whatnot
but why do we get bacteria-looking-ass districts out of it?
er, counties
er, wahtever<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because
they get areas that favor that party
that's why it look so fucking bad
even if it's like one little block<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but areas that favor that party<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>or one neighborhod<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>basically
with the census<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>by the smallest manipulable margin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you get to redraw districts<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>anything to get an edge<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and then you redraw them in ways that favor your party
so, for instance, instead of diving them in a way that makes sense
you divide it so that 3/5 districts will go your party
1 is a toss up
and 1 is the opposition<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>shit ive been chewing the aglet on my jacket strings so much i think the adhesive is starting to wear down<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>good
job
but yeah gerrymandering is basically the product of there being no regulations around it
so people were just like
hey fuck it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what i love mroe though
are filibusters
the notion is so rediculous
like how is there not a rule against it
fucking how<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im not sure
because realistically the american government is a little utopian in structure
so its assumed that no one would do that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you guys seen
that movie
mr. smith goes to washington
filibuster
yes
no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>hey y'all

<|start-block|>i um
probably
but like
yeah
you're right<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>I plan on having all my college apps done by dec 6
guess why<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>? :
peace of mind?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because Smash Ultimate comes out dec 7<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao
what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah i c<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>again jason<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>anyway
*my essay?*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I do good things<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ree<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for the wrong reasons<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just dont forget cause its already getting buried
its not an email
read it when you please<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>get back to me on my essay and I'll give it another peek<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I plan on submitting UW this sunday so I kinda need it done soon<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just looking at it i feel like its not 498 words<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it used to be exactly 500
I removed 2<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i uh
copy pasted it into word
yes, making sure i only got the essay
and it says 500
soooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
you might have the outdated version then
it should say "prefinal draft"
I updated the doc like 3 hours ago<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nope it says prefinal draft
with a comment that says
Planned submission date is Sunday, November 11th.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>funny
eh whatever
if it's 500 or less it works<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?
but uw says the best tend to be 3-400<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fran my first draft was 1400<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>25 seats for the dems
<:catblob:461594251378294784><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im not saying 500 is bad at all
just repeating UW's words
:^)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not sure where you got that from
but I believe that if they give me room to say something
I'll use the room to the best of my ability
I could and have cut this essay to under 400 words for different apps
but I feel like the 500 word one is the strongest version of it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and besides, I've already been told by two CCC advisors that what I have is either "close to final" and "really good"
so I don't feel like changing it drastically at this point could improve it in a meaningful way<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>literally from the office of admissions website
again, 500 is fine
its just a statistic<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I've been to several UW admissions panels, and the general gist of it was "write something only you could've written"
"Some of the best statements are written as personal stories."
I think my essay does a good job of that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but if I'm to speculate, I'm guessing the 300-400 word range is because UC essays are 350 a piece<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright i got some comments on your essay
nothing major, but some things I think you should consider anyway
sorry i'm not the kind to show how I would write it because, again, it's an essay about you and I dont wanna risk having you write in my voice, cause that just dont make sense. not to assume you would, but i know im prone to just copy people's revisions instead of wording it my way

<|start-block|>one problem with using an MX master at school

"No, it's a wireless mouse."
"Do you have any games on your laptop?"
"Yes."
"Play something!"
"No, I'm working."

well you gotta fill out his form
and send him a resume
wdym broken son <@!110137446053736448><|end-block|>

is proving more difficult than anticipated<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my way
or the high way
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk how to do it any other way<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
fuck you nuq<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my calculator cant do 5 + 100.0
anymore
i dont know why
apparently its doing things
with
fucken
AAAAA<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>are you looking at individual characters<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its
just
like
the
fuck
is
going on anymore
it can calculate things
until
like what
hold up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it is oh so messed up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pastebin me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its blowing up when i try to use my order method
so that's where we is broken

<|start-block|>Hello there
i agree
uh
thats fuckin
205?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WHAT the fuck is that?
WHAT IS THAT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>10 to the power of 2 is 100
times 2 is 200
+ 5 is 205
frn pls<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>where did that 2 come from
bruh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the 2 outside the parentheses<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its your calculator<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>shouldnt be there
hey alan can you give me a brief summary of what recursion is?
okay
the 2 is gone
that problem
is solved<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>recursion is alan's trigger word
<:catblob:461594251378294784> '<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that has not solved all the problems, however<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>define recursion
define recursion

<|start-block|>hey
hey alan
hey
hey alan
did you know<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jason I will kick you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>java has a fuction for that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my code is hella flawless<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>shit
I can't
he's got the same perms as me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see the thing is
i think
my calculator
is being recursive
also
i think
i need o take a second
go back
and look at something<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>recursion is basically when a method calls itself
so to call your calculator recursive implies you did something horribly wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well
heres the thing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and extremely unlikely that you made it recursive on accident<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it wasnt exactly on accident<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>parentheses calls calculate which calls order which calls scan3 then parentheses which calls calculate which calls order.... etc
i need to set conditions for when it needs to call order
i think those are working
but its still blowing up every time
and im not sure why<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but like
if it doesnt find parentheses
is it still gonna trigger
or if it doesnt find parenthesis will it go back to the rest of pemdas<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so what you've created is
a circle<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if it finds parentheses it will work the parentheses
if it doesnt
parentheses is skipped, i think
its a circle thats supposed to end
and i think it is ending
but its crashing?
idk man<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont think you know how circles work
```its a circle thats supposed to end```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"String index out of range: -1"
i mean loop, jason
you know that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>frn i am a very literal person<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what does "String index out of range:  -1" mean?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh
are you trying to pull the -1st character from a string?
cause theres array index out of range<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont think so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>which means you're trying to call array[-1]<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Strings are backed by arrays<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>somewhere, your code tried to access the -1st character of a String<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont see why it would ever
oh
oh wait
umm
hm
so my "should you call order?" condition
isnt working
i think
is whats going on
but the testing suggested it did!<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>test more motherfucker<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im confused
it's trying to take a substring
of nothing ?
at will?
cause its failing on substring creation
or whatever
charAt
or something
when that
isnt even being asked of it to do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fucking what
it'd determining that it doesnt need to do the order method again
then fucking *doing it anyway*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if needOrd is false, will it still run "order" or will it literally skip the block of code?
it's not reaching the println("Hello!")  below it
as if order is still being run again
and then crashing because of it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>@here halp<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you want help<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>I would advise you to put **at most** three conditional operators in a single if statement

<|start-block|>well but parentheses<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you need more, put it in another if statement<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>idk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my oh my i love stack overflow errors<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they fill up my console so i dont have any idea where things went wrong!<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>stack overflow errors usually mean your program entered a loop and ran out of memory
basically, you're going in circles and aren't leaving the circle
so check your method calls<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think the problem is
when its in an order method call
and it finds it has to do another
it goes kablooey<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what if the loop does have an end
but
it just goes to deep
and cant exit
because there's still work to do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then it continues into infinity
then crashes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what i find weird about my program
is that it succeeds
at doing some things
like
hold up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it does this
and this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but fails here
and things like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`sin 7 ^ 2` causes stack overflow
even with parenteses
maybe my scan2 method is broke<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait right
it doesnt work with sin
but with *s*
well kinda
with s
it gave ERROR but didn't *crash*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>aight that probelm is soled<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>is there a way to make it so stack oerflow
doesnt clog you console
so i can see how far it got in the process
and actually *debug*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no, because stack overflow is caused by running out of memory<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>:(\<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>therefore, your memory needs to be consumed by something
that something being all those method calls<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>can i just mention that i hate Prager U? it's not that they represent right wing ideas, its that they're PARTISAN PIECES OF SHIT.
PARTIES ARE FUCKING SHIT
GEORGE WASHINGTON WAS RIGHT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LITERALLY A PRAGERU ID PLAYED
(KEEP IN MIND THEY'RE MORE ASSHOLES FOR MAKING IT ADS)
THAT WAS LITERALLY JUST LIKE
"OH YOU CALL REPUBLICANS RACIST NOW? DEMOCRATS USED TO BE THE RACISTS!"
1) I KNEW THAT
2) WHY DOES IT FUCKING MATTER
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
rant done
please vote on policy not party
thank<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wtf
prager u is great
ive never seen a better comedian<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LMAO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>seriously though, why are parties a thing?
<@!111635656479952896> mr. polisci, enlighten me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh
i mean generally speaking people with similar ideals of how the would should work come together
due to how power is distributed in a democratic government it's advantageous to make your party as big and as widespread as possible
so political parties form by taking decisive stances on certain topics
generally speaking there is overlap in systems that are more than 2 parties, but a bi-partisan system starts to really hit a hard point
cause it makes it harder to express moderation in opinion and still be in a place thats relevant<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why are people greedy pieces of shit?
mr. polisci, enlighten me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>capitalism has been the dominant economic policy of the majority of the world for like 300 years or something<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>capitalism generally encourages the philosophy that moral rewards are less than monetary rewards<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then how...?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then how what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think you got that backwards<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you said moral > monetary
in capitalism<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>humanitarian stance: bipartisanism is evil because by nature 50% of the people are unhappy with the ones in power<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>moral rewards are less than monetary
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not that anyone asked<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i can definitely read
and am good read<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes alan
we know a bipartisan system doesnt work<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you can i read definitely read<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you just need to figure out how to explain that to everyone else
and frankly speaking creating a third party all on its own would be incredibly difficult without massive political reform<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im not saying make it tripartisan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so the most likely case is that we'd see social democrats break off into their own party or republicans divide between more rightwing and less rightwing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im saying listen to ol georgie<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>with what
you shouldn't have a country be divided?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah didn't he say parties would destory the country/democracy?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eh
parties aren't inherently evil<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but like
they are evil<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>symmetrical polarization doesnt work out well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>though not inherently they are eil
evil<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no?
both of them have different ideals of what america needs to be/should be
or different ideals of how to get to the point in where america is the best america it can be
its just that throughout the years symmetrical polarization has moved both parties further and further away from the center and to the right and left respectively<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what i see though is that due to people agreeing with *some* of a party's policies they just vote by party and not policy, which can lead to heated division and people oting for shit people. it also basically restricts (at least from what i know, feel free to correct me) what candidates can advocate because if they advocate the wrong things they're not in a party and don't get recognized. so they modify their policies to align more with the party and then people are voting for false fronts
again i dont think parties are *inherently* evil
but what we have kinda is<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what we have is just a bad situation
you're not wrong, we saw it when democrats took a hard line on abortion
and a bunch of formerly pro-life dems ended up going republican because while they were more democratic, they weren't going to get the democrat vote anymore<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but people voting by party not policy is more an issue of people only ever accepting one viewpoint and not looking at any others<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i feel like not having parties would help diminish that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well what happens when you don't have parties
you have 1-x candidates run for office
and overtime parties will develop as people will try to copy those that get elected
and slowly voters will vote for different candidates with similar ideals<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bare this torch against the cold of the night
Search your soul and reawaken the undying light

On that day, when the sky fell away
Our world came to an end
In our eyes stood a fading sunrise in the dark
glimmering shadows

Silence grows in the spaces between
Stretching out beyond time
Rising up as a chorus of souls finds a voice 
flickering through the void

These little sparks cling on to life
Everyone caught in the struggle
And then storms of change they fan the flames 
scattering ashes to the wind

Every soul contains a whisper of light
Gleaming faintly as it dwindles from sight
No escape no greater fate to be made
In the end, the chains of time will not break

Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bare this torch against the cold of the night 
Search your soul and reawaken the undying light

As fate spins a thread without end
New life draws its first breath
Blossoming in a soil reclaimed from the past
Where destiny holds fast

Here where we stand, hand clenched in hand
Everyone caught in the struggle
This is the day we finally find a way 
stepping into our tomorrow

Every soul contains a whisper of light
Growing louder as it calls to unite
From the distance sings a chorus of souls
Rising slowly stirring heat from the coals

Colors weave into a spire of flame
Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
Bare this torch against the cold of the night
Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight

Every soul contains a whisper of light
Growing louder as it calls to unite

Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight<|end-block|>

wtf<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I said 520
eh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh boy
college board
wont let me see
my ap euro test results

followed closely by the IB
```
The purpose of a conclusion to an essay like this should address the final part of the prompt, which is “demonstrates your character or helped to shape it”. Your essay does a good job of touching upon the “helped to shape it” part, but doesn’t dig much further beyond that.

If I were to suggest additions, it would be to elaborate on how you’ve “carve[d] out a new name for [your]self”. Show how your experience with the Vietnam vet went on to influence who you are, which is more than telling us you “felt a realization”. Show us that realization in practice.

Because we’re already at the limit, I’d suggest changing your conclusion to (what I call) an inspirational piece. Remember how my personal statement ended with “influence the world for the better”? That idea was taken directly from English and History classes: Conclusions should relate back to history as a whole, or society as a whole, joining the essay back with the rest of the world. This, by nature, is the least original part of the essay (plenty of people have said influencing the world around you is good), but taken in the context of your story, can show something about how the story taught you something that “demonstrates your character” AND “helped to shape it”.

That’s how I wrote my conclusion, at least.

Have fun.

can someone in physics confirm this for me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!105508293522264064> <@!110137446053736448><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it works<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the variable names are kind of weird<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>distance = height
not height = distance * constant lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but sometimes distance can be measured from side to side
not just vertically
hmm
height refers to the height of the triangle
not the distance the spring is compressed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>technically I could've done `0.5 * constant * distance * distance;`<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Were gonna need to take xrays to ensure your lungs are filled with shit
Also ya lol is shit but that kpop song is crisp
Ngl<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>havent heard the song
unfortunately he can't free himself
otherwise nobody will coach the esports kids<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>get me out of here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>u coming to ping pong tomorrow
i think i injured my self during practice on sunday ;_;<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the way my schedule's set up, I gotta be grinding physics for the next 3 weeks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i can test u<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>2 khan academy vids a day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ib cp
i will see what u know
bring ur book<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ken I'm 30/51 videos through
20 of those were kinematics<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kinematics is important
dont sleep on it
like i did<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*I skipped all the kinematic videos*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>were doing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because i got unlucky<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kinematics
in ciustea
and she will not
for the life of her<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kinematics is ez clap<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>let me just algebra it
and instead
i need to choose
one of the three equations<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>u have to
because later on<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idc about later on<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in "advanced" physics<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont wanna be in this class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ISOLATE THE VARIABLE YOU NEED TO FIND
fuck you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>those equations are the same
wat
i never had to do that lol
i just went kaboom<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah the kinematics equations pop up later
but with different variables<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
and tyhis is why<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i do not like rotational motion<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wouldve taken
fuckin world religions
and not
ib physics<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>literally all the equations u will see once
will appear again in ib physics<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how did this happen where you have physics and not WL?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have
no
fucking clue<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>go on strike<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wanted to do environmental sciences
but that was full<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how did you get IB phys and not IB CS HL?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so then they were like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>IB DIRT BABY<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why put you in fuckin
ib world religions
a class thatd you'd genuinely find interesting
when we could put you in
a literal fucking death camp<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gulag<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>remember when<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>AND I MIGHT ADD<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the term is gulag<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we got let out of the assembly early<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THAT HER FUCKING GRADING SCALE
IS THE SAME
AS LAST YEAR<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and cieusteau's like
FUCKING
WAIT TILL THE END<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>isn't it a fucking ib class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>BICHES<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>meaning that
one web assign
is literally worth
about 5% of my grade right now
and i wish i was fucking joking<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*webassign*
I remember when I had to PAY TO RECEIVE HOMEWORK<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>still do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>had to pay the fee again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yessir we gotta pay for it agin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and she still extends it
for fucking ever
so it literally doesnt matter
nevermind the fact
that the fucking<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what if you told her you couldn't pay for it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fowler was like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>assessment statements
which are
literally just notes
but graded
but not graded<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"Oh I have to write my own questions now so you won't have to pay for WebAssign"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because she just stamps it off as long as you have the first 4 done<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and that if she entered you as a 0 it was discrimination based on socioeconomics<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and then she was just like SIKE
it's still 11 dollars<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you can't pay for it
then the school will cover you
they just dont want to drop like
300 a class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fucking skyline<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fucking skyline<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you shouldve seen
issaquah
freshman year
we printed so much paper
by like
april
all of our homework was online<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why
just why<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because we weren't allowed to buy more paper<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>issaquah loves to kill trees<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>novel concept: have someone make a website that allows teachers to make homework problems to give to classes that we dont have to pay for! just pay the guy one and done and then server costs... i see why this would be an issue<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>aye
heres a fuckin thought
post the questions
on your website<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WOAH<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we'll do them on paper<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WOAH
THAT'S<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and hand them into you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THAT'S TOO MUCH
or do the parker way<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you dont like grading to the point where you are unable to do it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>give us problems to do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you probably shouldnt be a fuckin teacher<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just wanna say<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and we upload it to server<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like we're literally<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>I'm moderately confident that if Parker could write a program to literally teach the class for him, he would do it<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>half of the days he doesn't even speak to ajay or I<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats still<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we just kinda<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do whatever we want<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>white people cant say that word
<a:angery:400076290197159936><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well its dinnertime
so im gonna YEET my way outta here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is Parker's teaching methodology problematic?
I'd say so
because he kind of expects you to be self-motivated
and a lot of people aren't<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i liked the way parker teached
like as long as i could start getting interested in the question it was fine
if it was too easy/too hard i lost interest hard<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see that's the problem
parker doesn't care
he just gives you the content
then tests you on it
and doesn't care if you actually like the stuff or not
hell he doesn't even care if you're GOOD at it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lets go
check in
on the shit show that is my syria project<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>*begin rant*
so in prep for smash ultimate
I'm looking into getting an ethernet adapter for my switch
basically what I need is a USB to Ethernet adapter
preferably USB 3
but it might not matter because the switch's dock runs USB 2.0
but it might run 3.0 after a firmware update or something
no one's really sure
but I'm not getting an ethernet adapter for bandwidth
even though the wifi on the switch is shit (50mbps on a 300mbps network)
50 mbps is well over enough to support games like smash or splatoon
so the real problem lies in latency
ping
and what do you have it
the built-in speed test in the switch
doesn't fucking measure network latency
it only measures up/down speeds
and even those are useless because they run the tests between the switch and nintendo's servers
which don't even attempt to test the full extent of your bandwidth
so your actual dl speed could be 50
but the nintendo internet test would say 23
anyways<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I look up online, and there is a way to actually test the real speeds of your connection using the hidden internet browser<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it has something to do with logging into a network and the switch opens up a web browser then someone figured out they could set up a DNS address to redirect to google
so anyways
I could test the ping on my switch on wifi
it was like 20ms
which isn't absolutely terrible
but definitely noticable
so I look online to see if anyone's done comparisons between wifi and wired latency speeds
but not
a single
person has
everyone says the speeds they get with the adapter vs. without are basically the same
but nobody mentions anything about latency
which is the thing that
y'know
actually matters
so I'm stuck here
with my 20ms latency
and no idea if getting an ethernet adapter would help get lower pings

<|start-block|>you're
kidding<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>which is really surprising<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>holy fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how many of those fucks have never seen the copypasta before<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no clue
tbh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it was all over reddit when it first came out
kids these days smh
can't even remember the vintage memes
leave me banned

ive already unbanned you
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what no
ban me again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok

and purged the last week of message activity
so now it looks like brandon ranted into nothingness<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>good

<:FeelsBadMan:352976311813406721><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>guys
what if
in the OW discord
we made a channel
exclusively so that I can create bot accounts
to spam brandon with the halloween mercy copypasta
averaging 300 messages per second<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan i think that might be called a DDoS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!111635656479952896> i thought you were dying all day

And ill just do todays homework in a desperate attempt to keep up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i admire your dedication jason
if i were you id probably do nothing while sick
i definitely wouldnt be doing homework ahead of time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'd be working on college apps
imagine all that free time not doing school work<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I mean its a combination of id get really depressed if i did nothing all day
And i dont wanna fall super behind on schoolwork<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sad

<|start-block|>i should do
my uw personal statement<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>doesnt have to be your RAAAACE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!189852772475207680> new programming challenge
write a method to calculate the distance between two points, represented by integer arrays<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!145664386021720064> youre not wrong
but you and i both know that a lot of people see diversity as only race and not experienced based<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> how do i find the distance again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the distance formula
you nut<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o
o k<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but compare the ones for 2d
and 3d
then think about how you'd do it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so 3 arrays?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for nd
no
two arrays
ie
[1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6]
for 2d<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>[1, 2] and [3, 4]
imagine they're points<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>(4-1)^2
oh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```
public static void Distance() {
        int[] a = {1, 3, 5, 7};
        int[] b = {2, 4, 7, 9};
        double distance = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            distance += Math.pow((a[i] + b[i]),2);
        }
        distance = Math.sqrt(distance);
        System.out.println(distance);
    }
```
<@!478706068223164416>
this is 2d yes?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jk thats all<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a point (1, 2) would be represented by the array [1, 2]
another point (3, 4) would be represented by the array [3, 4]
so on a so forth<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this is a 4d point
it works for any dimension i think
just extend the array<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>looks like it works
but I said a method<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a method that accepts two arrays as parameters
and returns the distance<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OH IM SORRY<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```
public static int Distance(int[] a, int[] b) {
        double distance = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            distance += Math.pow((a[i] + b[i]),2);
        }
        distance = Math.sqrt(distance);
        return Math.toIntExact(Math.round(distance));
    }
```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay but
why didn't you just return the double?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol thought you wanted an int back<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why the fuck would I want an int back

<|start-block|>race card doesnt make sense
unless it really affects what you bring to the table
like if you grew up in a different culture

do we need like
a lot of critical reading
for the bad feminist shit
or can i just like
summarize on a separate page<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Howdy, my name is Rawhide Kobayashi. I'm a 27 year old Japanese Japamerican (western culture fan for you foreigners). I brand and wrangle cattle on my ranch, and spend my days perfecting the craft and enjoying superior American passtimes. (Barbeque, Rodeo, Fireworks) I train with my branding iron every day, this superior weapon can permanently leave my ranch embled on a cattle's hide because it is white-hot, and is vastly superior to any other method of livestock marking. I earned my branding license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. I speak English fluently, both Texas and Oklahoma dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their cowboy code, which I follow 100% When I get my American visa, I am moving to Dallas to work in an oil field to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become a cattle wrangler for the Double Cross Ranch or an oil rig operator for Exxon-Mobil! I own several cowboy hats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I rebel against my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond. Wish me luck in America!
<@111635656479952896> is this appropriation<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>probably?
idk i find it funny
but yea its probably some form of appropriation<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>CAN YOU APPROPRIATE AMERICAN CULTURE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk
probably<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>YEE HAW<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@111635656479952896> the reading due today is good but we need more shit for tommorow<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><:Pepega:502264151821778945>
i know
i have shit on like
women as CEOs
and leaders of the mormon church
my concept right now
is argue about what
"equal" means<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>goos
good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because frankly
i dont feel like arguing
if the genders are equal
also like
what about
non binary genders
do they count
in this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk
i guess you cab try<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><:thonk:412099896544329730>
no
im not going to get anywhere
are you kidding
the fuckin uh
gun control discussion
we had
basically devolved into
wow trumps not doing what he should<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i miss socratic seminars<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I got to impose my opinions on other people AND earn points for it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>people are<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>win-win<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuckin
dumb
"denmark was protestant"
ya
ok
mhmm
thats why
sleeping with<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay imagine an all stars socratic seminar<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>your husband's brother<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>who's in it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is incestuous
literally
fucking no one
its a quiet room
with padded walls
and me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay fine
an **enjoyable** socratic seminar
what would that look like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok
so
not like
95% of our block class
probably
along the lines of
me
you
nuq
fran
probably josh and aidan
and uhhh
maybe some other people idk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jarrett
??<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>who
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jcl<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jarrett but he can only use mao zedong quotes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats
wacist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but I can only make points related to China<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ooh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats all he does tho <@111635656479952896><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>can i only quote
architects songs
cause ive done that
consistently
in our fucking seminars and discussions
and its fucking brilliant<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh my lord why<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>b/c
i fuckin can
like who the fuck cares anymore
literally
all the fucking socratic seminars are<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no one you right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is a group jerk off session
because i have
the same fucking group of people
as last year
meaning that
one socratic seminar
is like a case study of degenerates
and the other
is everyone else
so its fucking feminist central<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>feminism is ez points<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that depends
like everything fucking else
if i feel like saying
what i really believe
or what matheny will like
and get me points<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>matheeeeeeneeeeeeeeee
glad I didn't get her again despite what I said at the beginning of the year<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like
you really think<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>boas is so much more chill<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you really fucking think
i walk into that class
and mention that
sure a lot of feminists have good points
but often express them in very aggressive or decisive ways
which in turn takes away from the message and creates the situations they believe are constant
when in fuckin reality
if we all just took a deep breath
instead of yelling shit like
fuck all men
we might get somewhere<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hence the problem with feminism
the name addresses half the issue<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>anyways
but yea im not gonna walk into matheny's class and say that
because everyone will give a large fucking ree at me
like
im gonna walk into matheny's class
and be the most feminist person you've ever seen
cause thats whats gonna give me the grade in the class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>aaron harris and his cultural appropriation foa
classic<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>man
that couldve been
so good
and then you take
dear white people
which i might add
is a great fucking show
and actually does a good job of addressing racism
but it had
NOTHING
to do with the time period<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the pure FINESSE that he needed to pull it off
the CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT'S what amazes me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what
that someone
fucked up talking about race
cause that
NEVER
happens<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for someone to fuck it up THAT BADLY
in an environment like this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
theyre gonna fuck up that badly in this environment
i will
bet you money
that everyone in that friend group
did not understand why aaron was pissed about it
like
idk so much here
but at ihs
which lets be honest
is basically fucking shs - ib
kids went around at lunch screaming the n word<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's the bored suburbia west coast culture
the conflict ridden world of hip hop and rap appeals to them<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ha
ha

ha
i swear to god
im actually going to go
fucking insane
at some point<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see <@!145664386021720064>
this is when
architects quotes
come in really fuckin handy
cause "we used to run with the wolves"
sums up my mental state atm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what makes y'all think i'd be suited for an all-stars soc-sem<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're capable of expressing your opinion in a way that isn't either spitting up what you read online or listing off evidence like its a constructed argument<|end-block|>

lmao
not only
was i told
that were moving in
a day before
they then said
"hey we're gonna let you work on homework today, we know you're busy"
you know
what ive been doing all day
moving fucking boxes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
super
nice
its not like i have a week's worth of homework
to do in a day
nope
not at all
:)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nope
nope<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what are you talking about?
you were at school every day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
you want
a bed made
well maybe then
we shouldn't ahve moved in
2 weeks early
?
legitamately
im the only person with a working shower
and a room thats vaguely put together
ignoring the fact that the majority of my clothes are in some storage unit
which i *may* get today
but we're not sure
which is fucking brilliant<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean technically
you missed 5 days of school
so you have 5 days to make up all the work<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i missed 3<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>b/c we had monday off
so tues/weds/thurs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>did you come on friday?
oh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then came friday
yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i was gone on friday<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ik
now you see
this makes everything due tuesday of next week
which is doable
if i had a fucking weekend
but here we are
dont even get me started
on fucking
ciustea
who is apparently
gone<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>technically wednesday<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>on monday<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause you have 1 day gone<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>meaning<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so 2 more<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that
i cant make up the physics test
unless
its wednesday morning
she still hasnt responded to my email on friday
which is also just peachy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh right
that test
is just peachy too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just need to get a better grasp on OM
other than that i should be fine
but holy shit man
like the level of incompetence is stunning frankly
all i ask
is to check your email
once a day
on the weekends
not very time consuming
could do it on your phone
frankly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it really extends past that it seems
cause her teaching sounds horrific<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
shes just
a bad teacher
in general
labs are usually poorly explained
which is great
because she then gets very annoyed when you do them wrong
nevermind if you talk in a normal voice
everything is too loud
so you're whispering basically the entire time
or getting yelled at by her every 5 minutes
the fucking worksheets
she gives us
are a joke
because her answer key is consistently wrong
like
possibly-doesn't-understand-the-content
wrong
not just
oh calculation error<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my only gripe with fowler is how she does labs to teahc concepts
fran shares this too
she does the lab first
which can be very confusing
then talks about the concept
i prefer the other way.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dude
holy shit
its the most annoying thing
ever
like
yes
i understand the lab is supposed to show us like
it in real world
but
lets be frank for a second
dropping fucking marbles from height isn't exactly a good way of seeing how objects will accelerate to a point<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah its
yeah
like i dont hate our school as much as some people do
i think its ok
but i cant wait to go to college<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>comparatively
the school is ok
cause ive been to a lot of schools at this rate
and it's considerably better than what you can have<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah youve said this one is ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but some people at this school like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ive only been to two<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>grind my fuckin gears
ive been to
six?
depends on how you count<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmmm
how do you count jason<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>SCDS Apollo SWS PCMS IHS SHS
six
but if you want to count
pre k
then its 8
but like
pre k is eh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i would be going to ihs rn but i went to one of the elementary schools that feesd to ihs
ive kept contact/seen the people that went to that school
and they're not as bad as skylines but yeah
some do still grind my gears<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there are people who are equally annoying at both schools imo
its just that
skyline has more people who are tolerable for me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and ihs really fucking doesnt<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats what im saying too
my brother went to ihs
for all 4 years
and oh boy
ooohhh boy
his friends were just<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao
i was friends with one kid<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>P E E K
H U M A N<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>who legitimately went on to say<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>K I N D N E S S<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>>non-american cultures dont matter<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>holy shit lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tfw american culture is literally a blend of other cultures<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>>why bother with learning history, it's not worth learning about shit old people did
ya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!145664386021720064> my problem with becky is that she teaches us the material THEN has us do a lab on it, so the lab is a complete waste of time cause i learned nothing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like obv
me and a lot of my friends are very trolly
so we just say dumb shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
wait
i thought it was the other way
i hate doing labs first<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then concept<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but he was dead fucking serious<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i fucking hate that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im ok with doing labs first
if im told what im supposed to find
if im not told what im supposed to find theres no point imo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if im told about what im looking for
cool<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk and i just lose concentration<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>something to guide me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in that class
soemthing about it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but when she teaches you everything you're going to learn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk what the fuck it is and its been 2 and a half months<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THEN you do the lab<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
i dont want like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there is no point in spending class time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>an exhaustive coverage of it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>doing a shitty lab<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just want like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats way too long and confusing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"hey this lab is gonna look at fucking waves and how they change"
ya ok
now its not like
oh we have water in this dish
and we add the thing
and we've learned nothing about this
so no one takes it seriously<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like i dont even understand the labs, i just know the concepts
000000000000000000000000000000000000000<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but yeah good luck on that test jason<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>meh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>even the try hards ik who've been paying attention say it was hard<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>probably wont take it
into
until
fucking december
so
#ciustea
<:LUL:301798789818220544><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>at this rate
she'll probs forget<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>isn't here monday
apparently cant like
give it to someone else and have them give it to me
cant take it tuesday or wednesday
cause im on call for both days right after school
sooo wednesday morning
but no response in 48 hours
<:FeelsGoodMan:399441633822900224><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is it me
or has this year just gone by fast
i feel like it has
but idk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it has
mostly because im focused on one bullshit thing at a time
and then everything else sorta goes by<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's the blessed 3 day week of thanksgiving already<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>blessed
wow
are you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and it doesnt feel like it's november<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>religion
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>buddy
we've hit the point<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its weird in my family<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>where im over christmas
<:FeelsGoodMan:399441633822900224><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my parents are christian and im atheist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my thing with christmas is that i never want anything
i'd rather get nothing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>than a bunch of shirts<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>id 100% rather get nothing
and spend quality time with family and friends
than get a bunch of shitty gifts i didnt ask for
and now will exist in my closet for 5 years<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im excited for my berd sweater
but other than that
myeh
i already bought that so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its to wear during christmas<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i kinda want a holy hell hoodie
thats
really about it
maybe like idk
ya no that's about it frankly
oh man
do you guys still do uh
christmas lists?
or ever did i guess?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think i used to
or i just did it once or twice
i've never really been into it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok but like
did you them with
glitter glue
and shit like that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause we
consistently
do it
and its the most
bullshit thing
ive ever experienced<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just a list on like notebook paper for my parewnts<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya see
i tried to do that one year
as like a
"this is what i guess i'd like"
nope
had to make one with glitter glue and everything<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause you know
tradition
despite the fact
we literally make them like
the week before christmas
so it's absolutely useless<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and the fact that
multiple times
my sisters will just staple a magazine to the list
so it's not actually helpful<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>whaddo you mean<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you know uh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>staple a magazine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>american girl dolls?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah..<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they have a magazine right
of like
"wow look at our products"
so when my sisters were really into it
they'd decorate a piece of construction paper
write in pain-inducing colors on like a lime green
and then
staple an american girl doll magazine to the back of it
as an extension of their "list"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>waow<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i hate
everyone<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like i already dislike the idea of lists
cause it removes like
the authenticity of the gift
and then i dislike the idea of setting day to get someone
and somehow thats tied to like
how much you appreciate them
because of scumbag marketing and societal pressure
but then you just staple a fuckin magazine to the back of your list
which is like
<:ANGERY:411986306705653760><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what is that face from its beautiful<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so i have to do
this creative
film project
for classics
with a group
and half of us couldnt meet yesterday<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>when's it due<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so me and this chick
have to do the second half
im looking
at what the first half did yesterday
and
they filmed it
guess
guess what they did
**fucking guess**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a puppet show<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no no no
its not what they filmed
its how they filmed it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>vertical<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>**fucking guess**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the sin
of vertical
THE SIN<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>***thats exactly it sir**
***you fucking nailed it***<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THE CARDINAL SIN
OF FILMING VERTICALLY<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>**h o w d o e s o n e e v e n t h i n k t h a t s o k a y**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wish it were just that
they filmed horizontally
and it saved vertically
cause that's probably an EZ fix
but *no*
i think i give up on life<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just do
puppet shows
or make an animation that's purposefully shot
shit
im talking like powerpoint shutterstock levels<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i said puppet shows because
last year for those edgar allen poe trailers
one group did a puppet show
and it was horrid
my group almost did it too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dude
that project
stressed me out
so fucking much<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like have you ever been in a group project
where your part is 100% done
but everyone else hasnt touched it to your knowledge<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
recently actually
with our social justice project
which we somehow got a 95% on<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
my social justice project went great
mostly because i didnt have to speak<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait really
what score did you get<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>58/60 i think?
mightve been 59/60
basically what happened
is that i gave gene all my research for context
and then gene said it
so i get to profit without presenting
and since my group is a bunch of people who are way to nice to admit i did less
my peer review is quality<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i would imagine so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>me too<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>It’s no secret that, even though I take my studies in computer science seriously, I find time to have fun with the skills I have. Every now and then, I’ll find an idea or a concept that I think could potentially be turned into something funny or amusing, and try to throw it together in an IDE as fast as I can. One such instance of these ideas resulted in the creation of a sassy little chatbot named Starbot.<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>"Starbot is, by many accounts, a mistake. His source code is a tangled mess of method invocations, cluttered nested classes and repetitious boilerplate. New features, if you can call them that, are often useless and serve little purpose other than providing a moment or two of amusement. If I had to make an analogy, Starbot is a cardboard box that I’ve continually duct taped modules onto with little, if any, regard to the expandability, sustainability, or efficiency of the product at hand. The only goals with Starbot were that it could run on an Amazon EC2 instance and that it was funny to interact with."<|end-block|>

seriously I don't even know what he has any more<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ooh here's a fun one
it works still
that's pretty good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its fighting back<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> fuck off
shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> how many KeyPhrases do you have<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OH
MY
GOD<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>FUCKING
TOO GOOD<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this guy
no shits<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"He started off as a simple call and response bot, responding to anyone who mentioned him with a sassy quip, pop culture reference, or occasional meme. Over time, more features were added — Starbot would now interject into a conversation whenever a key phrase was uttered in chat, responding to “shut up” with “you shut up”, responding to “what is love” with “baby don’t hurt me”, and my personal favorite, “sentient” with “what do you mean sentient?” Other features included music playback capability that would kick you from the server if you tried to play anything when it was 8:00 PM, a help command that provided a pastebin link to the source code as “help”, and a mute function to mute all current users in a voice channel."<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why are you going into so much detail about Starbot's function<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it essays asks what I do for fun
this is what I do for fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he's sentient he possesses full capabilities of a human, so the readers will know exactly what he's capable of<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>But for all the terrible practices, mechanisms, and tokens leaks, Starbot is a thing of beauty. Not beauty in elegancy, but beauty in the sheer fascination that it brings. I could have written Starbot in well structured, well documented fashion, using all the proper guidelines and design patterns that my long eight-year education in programming offered me, but I didn’t. It was never meant to evolve into a week-long project, much less a year-long one, and yet, I still regularly add a new phrase or quirky command to it every now and then to spark a few laughs out of my friends. The beauty and, I think, the fun that Starbot provides comes from the joy of pure, unrestricted experimentation. Every feature that Starbot has is a result of me coming up with some crazy idea and seeing with what capabilities of the API I could do it with in as little time as possible. Whenever something works for the first time, it stays that way, in an unpolished, raw state, forever.
Starbot’s one of the worst things I have ever created. But that’s why it’s so fun.<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because I respect Nintendo's right to release a game when they deem it's finished
unlike SOME PEOPLE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>peeps are to feisty
plus its kinda sketch<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>feisty
you won't find many communities as feisty as the smash community
all sorts of drama goes on there
especially between casuals/competitive
or between 64/melee/brawl/4 fans
or between fans of different characters
basically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>smash's community is nothing but a complex ball of arbitrary arguments<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's better to release a game that's finished
obviously
but that's not obvious to a lot of people and companies

<|start-block|><@!189852772475207680> want a programming prompt?<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>1. write a Fraction class<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>2. write a method called `reduce` that accepts a `Fraction` as a parameter and returns a new `Fraction` that is the simplified version of the original `Fraction`<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for instance, given a Fraction with a value of 4/20
`reduce(fraction)` would return a new Fraction with the value 1/5

<|start-block|>guys
remember my `add()` method
well
it's evolved
```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : add(a + b < 0 ? -1 : 1, b - b < 0 ? -1 : 1);
}
```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wtf is that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>triple ternary operator plus recursion
returns the sum of a and b
goes something like
is b 0?
return a
otherwise
if b is negative
add together a - 1
otherwise
add together a + 1
with
if b is negative
if b is positive
1<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that
makes
no
sense
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>given 2 and 3
it goes
a = 2 b = 3
then
a = 3 b = 2
a = 4 b = 1
a = 5 b = 0
returns a<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
that's really stupid
why would you do that

ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay let's do the math
160 calories in a serving of ruffles cheddar sour cream chips
9 servings in a bag
I ate about 2/3s of the bag
so 6 servings
6 * 160
we're looking at about 960 calories<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>big thiCC<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>on what account
do you need to gain weight
what even<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>at my heaviest I was 140
but I've dropped to 125 recently<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and youre
how tall<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>170cm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you
nuqqer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's about 5'8"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>considering
im told i should be sub 200
at 6 3
im not surprised<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i would find that difficult
as height increases
area increases by a power of two
but mass increases by a power of three<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>most sources say
between 170-210ish<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>170 is a skinny ass 6'3"
that boy's a tree<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this is male btw
female goes down to like
160-190
at 6 3<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well idk it's all personally really
if I were half a foot taller I'd aim for a solid 180-190
but that's just me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it comes down to a lot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and it depends on what kind of build you want<|end-block|>

She folded the green shawl about her shoulders. She took his arm. His
beauty was so great, she said, beginning to speak of Kennedy the
gardener, at once he was so awfully handsome, that she couldn't dismiss
him. There was a ladder against the greenhouse, and little lumps of
putty stuck about, for they were beginning to mend the greenhouse.
Yes, but as she strolled along with her husband, she felt that that
particular source of worry had been placed. She had it on the tip of
her tongue to say, as they strolled, "It'll cost fifty pounds," but
instead, for her heart failed her about money, she talked about Jasper
shooting birds, and he said, at once, soothing her instantly, that it
was natural in a boy, and he trusted he would find better ways of
amusing himself before long. Her husband was so sensible, so just.<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Okay, so I've finished Shovel Knight's main campaign. I know nobody asked for a review but it's such a popular game I really feel like sharing out. 

.          Overall, I would say I had a good time with the game. The first time playing through a level was always fairly exciting, not knowing what new enemies I would encounter or new mechanics I would be introduced to. It was really nice having all of my important moves (really, all that there are)--jump, drop attack, and scoop--right from the get go and seeing just how much you could do with such a simple loadout. It was nice finding all the secrets I could, truly dedicating myself to a level to find everything in store. I took risks and I made mistakes but each step of the way helped me learn and try something slightly different each time. I can't quite decide what my favorite stage was, but as far as soundtrack goes, Specter Knight's level's music was definitely my #1. The music was quite spectacular the majority of the time (not a fan of Polar Knight's level's music), which is always a plus. Reading everything the NPCs had to say to get hints as to what to do or look out for in the game is something I absolutely adored.<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>So, Mr Finn, what're the board game plans as of now?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tldr its complicated
thinking around new years, anywhere from 30th, 31st, 1st<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>K k.*ool<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>people have plans for new years so leaning to like
noon on the 1st<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>K.*ool<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>b/c we have the second off iirc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Second is first day back<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i thought 3rd was?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Nope<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>That doesn't negate game day though
1st isn't the 2nd<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes but you see
axis and allies (current planned game)
is a long boi
so i could set up early
but its still a  lot of time youre looking at<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Does it take, like, 10 hours?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>potentially yes
if everyone knows what theyre doing it can take less
but if people dont know itll take a while
which is why id prefer having it at a time where people can like, stay up late and not be terribly punished<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok heres the new plan
fill this out
thanks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> you drink it?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>How was it?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok hello friends

you're all incompetent and i hate you
so we're doing
two
game days

<|start-block|>Neat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>frn
you're the reason this is happening

and can't be there the same day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok so like
hmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> yes it was good?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>What's the other day?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhhhhh
it depends?
its probably like
the 31st
maybe the 29th<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>29 th wansnt an option you gave<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
this is an accurate statement
are you good on the 29th?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>31st is a big fuckin no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>On the 29 th I'm good after 2p<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>God I'm frikin exhausted

<|start-block|>But it's a step in the right direction, before it was just "various gameplay adjustments"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i know the games new af
so its probably gonna be shit
but hey
everyone's saying leffen's is super bad so can this be that bad?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Zero was the best smash 4 player in the world, I'm pretty sure he knows what he's talking about<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leffen was good too though right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>He's one of Melee's gods<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan its 1036 why are you on mobile<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>im 2 feet from bed
also zero's stream just died l o l<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I gotta figure out how they changed link

inkling and peach so far in S<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Week 1 Fully Ordered ZeRo Ultimate Tierlist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so far the patch labbing has only yielded bug fixes
no real balance changes to be seen
all 3 links had issues with their bombs addressed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>his list is shit
KING k. ROOL is god teir
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so many above average
like B tier<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>K
All I said before<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so

and it didnt even ask for my product key
it just gave it for free<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Niiccee<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i thought that period was over
like over 1 1/2 years ago
when they were doing it for free
oh well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tournament rules?
3 stocks 7 minutes
no items no fs meter
starters are FD battlefield and smashville<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and any clones<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the exact counterpick stage list can vary<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also <@!110137446053736448> add me<|end-block|>

it's portable<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rite<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also like
if i wanna unlock the full roster
is there a specific way i should be doing that
or<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>It's possible to cheat the system
Make the rules 1 stock
Fight cpu
Commit suicide
Beat approaching challenger<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean fran
im pretty bad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Completely close the app
Open it back up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im working on consistently beating cpu
o
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Rinse and repeat
Well Idk if you have to beat them
I'm assuming yes
Otherwise there's a 10 min cooldown on unlocking a new char<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont think so
at least not the cpu
also fun fact<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Idk that's what Muli saidon stream last nought<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>some stages have destructible ground<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Yes
This is true<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i had no idea
and used bowsers down b<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@478706068223164416> I'm wearing my "Insert Technobabble" shirt tomorrow<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>1986 nlcs game 6 october 15th 1986
thats my picture<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>all i see is some dude in a black, sleeveless KKK outfit
sorry<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats
my dad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hes peeping there against his brother
the guy with his hands raised<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>forgive my confusion but this is what i see<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!145664386021720064><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh my god<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WELL WHAT IS IT
that doesnt help
at all
i just see his pants now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>still doesnt help tbh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what sport does that look like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the guy still looks like a dark kkk man
it looks like baseball yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the scary guy in the back is the umpire<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but that doesnt change the fact that he looks like a black kkk man<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>who calls balls and strikes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's fucking 1986 video quality what do you expectr
1
9
8
6
32 years ago<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mhm
this doesnt change what i see in the image
just explain to me why that mans head looks like a kkk hood
and we're gucci<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>umpires wear a protective mask like a catcher and since the video resolution and quality are really bad, the color and mask just blend into one
like a hood
you can see the slit on the mask where the umpire's eyes are<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>can i get a reference for what it's supposed to look like?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i dont see it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you wanna see
a higher def
of the same angle
but 31 years later<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sure?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is it clearer there<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>are you sure that's the same angle<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's probably sightly more to the left
and it's a different stadium
but it doesn't look like a hood now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also why are you being a good boy and not playing smash
you've been a bad boy for a while now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's what i see now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and to reply to you -- my mom would probably crucify me
idk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think you're just blind<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THAT'S CLEARLY NOT
WHAT THE GUY IN THE FIRST PICTURE IS WEARING<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the same fucking thing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>NO ITS NOT
WHY DOES THE GUY IN THE FIRST PICTURE
HAVE A SPIKE ON HIS HEAD<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>spike?
can i have your brain<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look at my drawing
l o o k a t i t<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes i see your drawing
his head is like a graph that cant be differentiated<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>spike<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yse
this looks looks dark souls mimic trying to be a bear trap
rainbow six's bear trap specifically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*maybe that's what that guy's head is*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i see what you're sayikng
why does that man's head
look like wunnadose<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause he's old
man
why cant you just play smash and do college essay
you know
*restrain yourself*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because
this is
the most effective form of restraint
abstinence<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how many colleges do you have left to apply to
tthat need an essay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i havent done SU's paragraphs

<|start-block|>im sure

<|start-block|>it's just they give very nice scholarship<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is super hard to get into

<|start-block|>i only have like
2 hard schools left

<|start-block|>how much crap're you applying to?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>11 schpp;s
osadfki
jkwiow
i had a stroke<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>w h y<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why not<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>money<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i honestly have to only try hard at like 5 or 6 of the applications
maybe 7 debately<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how much do the apps cost?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh
usually just under 100 like 60-80
plus there's sending SATscores
and my 5 free transcripts are almost up
cause common app thank god is only once
and you can send it to every school<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you're paying about 550 dollars on application costs
alone?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kinda yeah
alan payed way more<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gaddamn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a lot of people payed a lot at our school fran
cause they applied to a lot of big schools<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that just shows they're not confident in their #1
?
gotta aim low boyos
we're all garbage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well yeah most of the IB dip kids are insecure<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then why're they in IB dip ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause they're parents forced it/peer pressure
ik most are like that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>**peer pressure** oh so almost like me?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean i picked it *willingly*
no one told me to pick it with them<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i didnt even know you were doing diploma lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i was
i dropped it cause math<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wasnt actually peer pressured, although i felt like i wass expected to do it
cause im smart boye<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i finished junior year with 3 A's, 2 A-'s and a beautiful
beautiful
C<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>n i c u<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and i was keeping up with my CAs
did a good draft on my EE
and then

<|start-block|>CAs?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah math is going to kill me
CAS
Creativity, Acitivity, Service
as some memer still in IB about it

<|start-block|>i just didnt wanna deal with that
extra crap<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean it's literally just extracurriculars<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and thought i might not even do enough IB classes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you just have to write about it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*look at me now bitch*
also EE
eugh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes i did that
my draft was 3600 words
it's gone
deleted
forever gone<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>***n i c u***<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the IB dip kids i interacted with
where not very good at time management
for example
alexander park<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>whuddabout
samyak
sawale<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i never talked to him are you kidding me
why would i know that
YAK IS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>omg you were spared
i never interacted with him much
but he seems *obnoxious*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>frn i only had to suffer under his annoyance in 8th grade, i got the message across with my constant deflections and usual demeaning look towards him
that i dont
want
to talk
to him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>from the moment i met him in 8th grade i felt like something was off about him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he is obnoxious<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think it was how he dressed all fancy
in 8th grade<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he's the biggest bullshitter i know<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he still kind of dresses fancy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sure
i was just trying to stress that it was 8th grade
and he cared
lol
who in the motherfuck cares in 8th grade
**lots of people**
who said that, me?
SHOW YOURSELF<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eheheh
fucking 8th grade
i had the whole indian posse in my LA/SS class
5th/6th

<|start-block|>Karan has always been cool<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i also think you were in 3rd<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk why he associates with em<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>with jarrett
karan is meh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have never had a class with jarrett<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kinda dickish like them
not as dicksish
but enough to associate with them<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i suppose
i think at one point though
he was trying to cut ties
in like 10th grade
he failed
poor soul<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>maybe i should've talked to him more in comp sci last year
oh well
oh yeah how is comp sci going son
how are ARRAYS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just fine
arrays are cool
hella usefel

<|start-block|>```java
package aliqon{
    public class Fuck {

        public Fuck(String fucker){

```
like bro
fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>useful<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah its kinda dumb
i really dont know what to say
it's the only thing i have left to fill out<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well
you could go
the unique route
but i imagine thats used a lot
eccentric
might be a good idea<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is
italian
an acceptable answer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the blank to be filled in is below average/average/above average/excellent/outstanding
the because is the details<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
my personality is below average because im italian
done<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao
ill just say above average<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well why are you above average fran<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im cool-headed and flexible and a problem solver and shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>youve not solved any of my problems<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>:glare:<|end-block|>

whatever will i do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>:thumbsu\
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sin:<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>god i hate this feeling of commiting self-fallatio just to appease the counseling gods
i feel like i sound like a dick
lemme be self-deprecating, college<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it could be worse fran
you could be
this kid<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do you think this is acceptable
this is my honest thought<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is there
really not a way to set alternate colors as always being used
feels bad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for smash?
im not sure but whenever ZeRo selects a character an alt color is preselected<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>My favorite part is seeing the engine un-render textures that are still on screen to save processing power LUL<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eyy bb
wanna smash?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i would love to
not done with college aps
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I would join you but I lost my earbuds somewhere
along with my jacket<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan why it no work good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you have two separate calls to `nextLine()` happening
once in your `if` statement<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes i noticed that just now
adjusting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>another in your initialization<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>er, trying to adjust
now it just skips the title entry ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>paste again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its uglier now but the title prompting *works*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i really don't understand why it only reads every third input for the students though
er, i do in part
i see why it'd be every other
but not every third..<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're still calling `nextLine()` three time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh wait nevermind
im dumb
lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>only ever call `nextLine()` once
and store it
then compare that string<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then work with that sring yeah
kk thanks dad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>np son<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh no
oh
wait
i see what's happening

how do i have an A- in this class<|end-block|>

<|start-block|><@!110137446053736448> your use of a strong, consistent style tells me you're well ahead of your classmates
you can tell a lot about a programmer based on the way they name their things
and the indentation and spacing they use
my only suggestion for you is to put spaces after your `if` and `while` keywords
`if(condition) { } -> if (condition) {}`
just makes things a little easier on the eyes
oh
and comment more
fucking comment<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I guess but in my head it makes more sense for them to be "physically" connected since they're virtually connected
And yeah you rite<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's so you can do things like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`for (BigDecimal bigDecimal = new BigDecimal(10.0); bigDecimal.doubleValue() < otherDecimal.doubleValue(); bigDecimal.setValue(bigDecimal.doubleValue() * 2) { ... }`
because the conditions can sometimes be ludicrous
by the way that's a valid for loop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!145664386021720064> can you teach <@!105508293522264064> how to ski?<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>any miniumum?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>she said it should be 1000-1500 words but said the lower bound was flexible just that you might not get depth if you go below. idk how she feels about the upper bound<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Alan what did you think of my ryu yesterday?
I'm the best right?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>best ultimate ryu I've ever seen
coincidentally the only one
but best nonetheless<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>See
I'm the best
I'm gonna rek everyone<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!111635656479952896> get switch online so I can smash your ass<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>But college apps
I flipped the coin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
lmao
im not even allowed to play it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>And it confirmed that I will resist the urge to play before I finish apps<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fran I did the same thing
except I decided it before the game came out
everything was done by dec 7<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Good job
I'm not sufficiently intelligent to do that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>those last few hours between turning in my last app and the launch hour were torture<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>god fran you're so stupid for making a completely mature and reasonable decision to not play a video game until you've completed work pivotal to your immediate future<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I meant I wasn't smart enough to do my apps early lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how many do you have left?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Idk exactly what I have left to do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>If I can reuse my coalition essay for Western then I should theoretically be able to finish tomorrow
Also if I don't get really distracted
Watching smash ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well good luck with that
if you need a revisor I'm open<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I've already read several iterations of <@!105508293522264064>'s essay on eating pig ears
nothing really fazes me any more<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>What
<@105508293522264064> care to explain?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i gotta finish too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Do it so we can smash together<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but insurgency sandstorm is too good
i dont have a switch
insurgency sandstorm is my "smash"
its so fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Abstain until you finish apps<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i will now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Throw away your router
Then fish it back out when you're done<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Yes, blue kkk man<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait a minute<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>INSURGENCY SANDSTORM<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
it's fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>insurgency was fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the sequel is a lot more refined<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I can't believe I got summoned for jury duty
when I'm not even an adult yet<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Gameranx's Jake Baldino likes it and he wasn't a big insurgency fan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sure, I'll be 18 by the time February rolls around
but fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Wait what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait
youre going to jury duty<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>coulda waited a few months, eh
yes sir
jury duty<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>literally 45 days after I turn 18<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>i'd just like to mention that Dragonball FighterZ is really cool to watch<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it is good game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>have you played it?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
at PAX
and one of my friends plays it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey are you working on essays???!?!?

<|start-block|>neat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>smash day 15
over 70 hours logged<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>currently debating on whether to focus on link or young link<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>linky link<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>both have their strengths and weaknesses<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he looks cooler
or toon link<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that is a good point<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause he looks best<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that
is less of a good point<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the situation is
link is slower than young link<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey
fran
wana do somthing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck you matthew<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im bored<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but jesus he hits hard
and he's actually pretty fast
just
not as fast
as young link<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yl cant kill tho<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>who struggles to kill
yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do you prefer to fight indefinitely or actually win?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's a question of whether I want big damage slowly or little damage fastly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause if you prefer to win
play chrom
lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I guess it can change based on matchup<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>or i n k l i n g<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah I'm not gonna play inkling
I main based on franchises I like
not tierlists
but I will play chrom<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>king k rool<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh a respectable human i see<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because I played awakening and I like him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i play ryu cause
he look cool
and i wanna get good at inputs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that is a good reason<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>one day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>note that his aerials cancel into his specials
so fair into up b is actually a combo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i will get full charge focus into dash forward into input shoryuken<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>down b forward forward down low forward a
one day
one day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you gotta finish college apps first<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey
hye
i have common app
open
on my laptop
buh-bitch<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>go you <a:SuperPomPom:512316435859767296><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i also have zero open on my pc
so there happens to be a dilemma<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fucking<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>superduperpompom<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><:LDreally_thinking:469648655427567627><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wut<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>young link does have several kill setups
with bombs tilts and boomerangs
and can edgeguard easier
but
link can just outright kill
with tilts and bombs
I guess my strategy will be
against link's good matchups, play link<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just play both HAhaa<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>against his bad ones, play young link
fran that's not actually unfeasible
they are the same character
with different sizes and bombs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and toon lank is their average
soo
sooooooo
soooooooooooo
soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>toon lank more like toon jank<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oof
but Link is more hype than yoink<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oof.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>discord is eating my messages
so I'll lean towards Link<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the message failed to send
it's eating mine too
i meant to send that earlier
as have these<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because of the remote bombs
fuckin discord
eat someone else's messages<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>guess its past its lunchtime
it's being indiscriminate
equality!<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416>
dont forget grab ranges
its def something to consider
grab range/speed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>link has one of the fastest grabs in the game
yoink has a tether grab<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats what im saying
what're you more comfortable which
although now that i think of it
yoink's grab would complemetn is playstyle
as a zoner no?
so it wouldnt be that big of a deal<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>having a tether grab in a world where everyone else's grabs are nerfed is a pretty big deal
though link gets more combos out of his grabs at low percents than yoink does<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also consider
with big link
you get big link energy
and nothing can really compare to big link energy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>AND you get to choose when to detonate
i feel that's pretty huge
but big link energy is probably vastly more important<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@110137446053736448> have you started running yet?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my dad invited me on a run for later today

<|start-block|>idk what that is<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the 11 mile trail on east lake sammamish pkwy

<|start-block|>never heard of it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh my lord
you ve seen it. it starts righy next to share tea
and when youve dropped me off<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>maybe i just dont pay attention
90% of the time when i drive now im on autopilot
and lost in my head<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats fair<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if i am paying attention its usually to the car right in front of me
or im on the highway looking for exit signs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuckin perfect<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its the thing that is close to costco
the big ass trail that goes around the fucking lake<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah
how do i calculate how much college credit im going to get from IB?
do i just not?
WWU asks for it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh
i think thats only if u did running start
idk if ib classes count as college credit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but normally after u get accepted u cant send ur transcript and they will tell you if any of the classes you took will transfer
ohh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you do well enough on hl tests you get credit afaik<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmmm
idk
then see if u did well enough i guess?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i havent taken any ib tests yet
they're in may big boy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>welp

at 1.9<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bro just play ganondorf<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>^<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>My ton link is at 50k gsp :D<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>solid ?
my gsp was jumping a few hundred thousand during the first few matches I played
but after about 10 it started to slow down to a few ten thousands<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I swear my double jump just vanishes sometimes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>good practice is to not spam jump
because if you jump and are hit immediately after it's hard to tell if you jumped or not<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>But it's like I jump from stage to off stage
And suddenly don't have a second jump
Despite not being hit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that could be because you double jumped really close to the ground
like
jump
then another jump 3 frames after
take a replay of a match you sd in and see what the cause was<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oWo found kenneth driving<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oof
at a car crash i assume<|end-block|>

<|start-block|><@!110137446053736448> doubles?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>curiously the only throw ridley can true combo out of is his earliest kill throw (unless you count side-b)
he can get down throw shorthop fair until about 35 and downthrow fullhop fair until 70ish
and downthrow stragiht killed daisy at like 170
i.e. ridley has no kill throws bar side b
so he can only kill by juggling people offstage, smashes, or backair
oh and up b
y a y<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>at least up throw does 14 damage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lastly, for whatever reason, his downb does 60 damage, BUT it can stale until it deals just 28 (as if that would ever happen)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>actually one more thing
his fireball can red flash at 550%<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Now, woinenwe mean women en masse- with all respeet be it said, ane just at present, in the matter of polities, even in the largest and beat sense of the word, Tery much in the position of minors with regard to the manage- ment and disposition of property. Of their capa bilities after proper training, and of their final political deatiny, we say nothing. We simply assert that women, as they are, are not fit to vote. Even if facts be generally disagreeable disgusting things, which it is desirable to ex clude from polite circles, it is at least a duty and it seems to us a ster and imperative one, to look them in the face, when it is pro- posed to double the number of voters in the State, by conferring the suffrage on an entirely e and untried class of the population Therefore, we must firmly but respectfully request Mr. LoNasHLT and all our gentlemen readers, to think over, pa- tiently and impartially, the amount of political knowledge, political judgment, possessed by the large and highly-respectable cirele of their own lady friends. We do not,-as astump orator would be apt to do,-request them to cast their eyes upon all the females in the Union, but simply to confine their observations to those of them whom they know best n admire most. How many of them ever devote ten minutes to the consideration of a political question? How many of them possess the means of estimating the effect of any meas- ure upon either liberty or property? How many of them are competent to main- tain their own views for five minutes against tbe arguments of husband, lover or brother How rany of them, in short, have any sufi cient interest in public affairs to render it por- sible for then to study them with prot?

<|start-block|>new single by doc wenton
Doc Wenton - Yum Cha
part of a new album called "Free Trial"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this time around, I went a little more towards dance/hiphop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>feat. a Pipa, Piano, Erhu, and the stock FL Studio drums<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my friend says
"this isn't your mother's ukulele beat"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I am glad you are christening more people in the enlightenment that is doc wenton
up-and-coming underground asian lofi hip hop/hip hop/dance artist
where the motto is<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he says
its good
but its electro swing
and much better with another beat ontop of it for a good half of a song<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"you've built a wonderful concrete foundation but left it abandoned for someone else to build"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>up-and-coming underground asian lofi hip hop/hip hop/dance/electro swing artist
tell him thanks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and I'm flattered that you think my 55 minutes in fl studio trial is worthy of critique<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>remember kids<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>u making an album?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
set release in 2024
the dealio with fl studio trial
is that I get the full capabilties of the software
but<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>YOOOO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I can never reopen a project<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hype<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so every song I make is done in one sitting
and usually
I get bored after an hour
so really<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>can i preorder<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>everything doc wenton makes is made in under 60 minutes on a whim
sure
just like
venmo me
five dollars
I guess<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont have venmo ;-;<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>go get one you fucking buffoon<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>does share tea count ?
once i get the vroom vroom we can goto sharetea<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>That works<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>It always makes me laugh when people consider Doc Wenton as a serious artist
Giving critiques and pointers and stuff<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>It's flattering that they think it's deserving of their time, but it really just amounts to a pillow fort being critiqued by a civil engineer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?????<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@105508293522264064> should I play one of my songs at the next spartan night live

My senior exit interview was on Wed Dec 12<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>And I remember distinctly taking off my jacket and leaving it at a lunch table with friends before going in for my interview
That's the last thing I remember about leaving my jacket somewhere<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Oof<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>someone prob stole it
which is what im assuming happened to mine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why
is your first assumption
always
someone stole it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why would someone steal a jacket
like
a laptop
cellphone
literally anything else
everyone already has a jacket at skyline
why would you steal someone else's
I carry ~$2000 worth of electronics with me every day
and you choose to steal my jacket
?

<|start-block|><@189852772475207680> i found Jiang laoshi on reddit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>watching Izaw's lastest smash video made me realize the area I suck the most in is spacing
with the greater problem being I lack any sense of patience in neutral<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>basically, growing up as a ffa junkie, playing 6 player smash with my family has given me an impatient playstyle that's easy to punish
but also extremely explosive if I get into advantage
basically
if you're trying to beat me in a match
you have to
1. outspace me
2. punish me
3. never let me hit you
if you can do two of those three things, you can beat me easily
<@!189852772475207680>
ahem<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think
the greater solution here
is just to get good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this is actually one of the best guides I've ever seen on competitive smash
if you wanna get better at the game for any reason
pub stomping, destroying friendships, winning tournaments, farming gsp

<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> ive seen that shit since freshman year<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>cannot
soz<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> when u have time can u solve #9 of this problem https://www.cs.plu.edu/~blahakd/HSProgrammingContest/Contest2018/ProblemsAdvanced2018.pdf<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's pretty nutty
easiest way would be a flood fill<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>one sec
imma send u my friends code<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it'd be like
a college level problem
if you actually had to trace your path<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its a problem we're probs gonna see
on our competition next saturady<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>can u try to do it pls?
even if pseudocode<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and @ me if u did it ty ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how complex do you want it
maze traversal is a pretty deep topic if you look into it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>simplest
bc u have 3 hours to solve 12 problems
so fastest way to solve it
and pls explain how
bc this took the best guy on our team 3 hours to solve it alone
he had breaks ofc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>1. load the "map" into a 2d array
because dealing with scanners and nextlines and stuff is just gonna be annoying
so now we have a a * b dimension array of chars with all the elements on the map in it
2. flood fill
from the starting point
try to go left
if you can go left
do so
if there's a wall there
try going down
then left
if you can't go down
go up
etc. etc.
^ somewhere in there make sure you don't accidentally step backwards from where you came
because then you're in an infinite loop
3. check if the tile you're on is the checkpoint you've been looking for<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if it is, that means you've found the shortest possible path to that checkpoint through brute force
repeat this process using this checkpoint as your start
and start progressing towards the next one
until you reach the end
4. it's probably done
that's essentially a flood fill algorithm
extremely high computational overhead
but dead simple compared to other methods<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>to find the most optimal path, you'd have to repeat the process once you've found the checkpoint at all intersections where there was more than one valid path
to ensure you've actually found the shortest path<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!143076303736668160>
that probably makes a little bit of sense
but for the way I would try to do it
^ look at this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>huh
ok thank you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416>

<|start-block|>I can do either<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>would all be around may
naturally<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why would they make them at the same time
like
ffs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause AP and IB werent meant to mix
they're polar opposites
interlake has a mix of AP and IB
AP is about memorization
and teaching to the test
IB is about discussion
and genuine learning
so they
';re not supposed to be done toghet
but<|end-block|>

3-2
last stock<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>scummy timeout strats<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>suuuper close<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>neat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my predictions
if void wins over zackray, he'll win over mkleo but lose to samsora
if leo wins over samsora, he'll lose to void but win against zackray
esam will get 2nd<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but light's lowkey champion material
sooo
depends
light or esam 2nd
1st is up in the air<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pika has a frame 5 bair and a frame 3 nair
buuuusted
esam's right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lylat is wack<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>quite indeed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck there goes my bracket
but damn that was a close set
even if it was a 3-0<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Rip esam<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>last stock on all games, high percents on all stocks
i think esam just wasn't getting his combos going<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I really like esam
Feelsbad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>light had his confirms and combos on point
esam was strugglin to find his at most interactions
but still
damn close<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Quite indeed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>light still isn't sponsored
what's wrong with this world<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i want cosmos to win mostly because i want dabuz to lose<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well that's disappointing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dabuz has been a strong contender in smash 4 and ultimate because of his playstyle
he chooses to main the characters that let him control how the game is played
last game it was rosa
this one it's olimar
he makes you play his game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Oli seems obnoxious<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dabuz is obnoxious
starbot stfu<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>samsora vs mkleo
don't park on the grass grand finals rerun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Yeet<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>samsora is the definition of a master of his character<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Peach v 
Ike?
Does Leo still play okay?
Ike*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but mkleo has been poised to be top 3 of ultimate season 1
leo won dptg with his ike vs samsora
so I'm guessing he's not gonna change it up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>samsora takes game 1
on bf of all stages<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Hmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>people complain all the time that ike's gameplay is all nair
but that's actually one of his greatest weaknesses
as good as a move as it is
his entire kit revolves around it
so if you have to tools to deal with it
ike falls flat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so it's really impressive that leo can go against samsora, a master of an aerial character, with a character with literally one slow aerial move that he relies on for his entire gameplay
like
leo needs to space EXTRA godlike to not get punished by peach
and lemme tell you
nair isn't all that fast<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo takes game 2
i think he got more reads down than last game
which is important, because against peach the only nairs ike is gonna get are off reads<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see
if both leo and samsora are shielding
and they both jump oos
samsora wins every time
because ike is
by nature
a slow character<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>aight that entire stock samsora just got hit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo started grabbing samsora's shields more
so samsora stopped shielding so much
but leo nair'd him
then ftilt'd
then dair'd<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that last stock
hype
samsora played that suuuuper smart
leo's recoveries are getting caught now
samsora's adapting hard and leo's starting to fall behind<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uyp
samsora started catching more of leo's recoveries
and won more grab/nair 50/50s<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>void is the pioneer of pichu
if anyone's gonna win this with a pichu, it's gonna be him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think the problem for void is
if he's winning
he's already hurting himself
and if he's losing
he's still hurting himself, but this time he's losing
so he really needs to keep the lead as much as possible
because making comebacks as pichu is nigh impossible
especially against wolf
because pichu will explode against an ftilt<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah void's making bank on his attacks
he trades 2 percent for 20
zackray isn't getting a chance to retaliate, save for ledgetraps, frametraps, and just reads<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yup
one fsmash
that's it
nighty night pichu
game 5<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>void had wayyy too big of a lead to choke
he woulda had to sd to lose that game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>now that zackray's in losers
I think we're gonna see a samsora/leo grands rematch<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>light vs. leo
it all depends on how many of ike's combos actually work on fox, one of the hardest characters to combo
if nair to up air still works, leo has a chance
if light shuts out leo's slow aerials, he'll win free
either way
an interesting match<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh he went luci
well fuck I guess it's anyone's game now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OOH
nice
that's actually huge<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>BOI<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not just for the stock
but for the mental game
light's gonna be scared to shield now
and a HUGE mental comeback for leo after losing that stock in a kinda cheesy way<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>damn this luci MOVIN
yeah that shield break really gained him TONS of momentum<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fsmash at ledge
classic ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I can see why leo opted to go luci though
he needed a character with a faster advantage to exploit fox's bad disadvantage state
for edgeguards and stuff
and juggling
though luci doesn't have the greatest disadvantage either
so it's still not completely free<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>damn those smash attacks missing by FRAMES
damn but good job to light on that recovery
two techs and a reverse edgeguard
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo played that super solid
I think light dropped some of his pressure though
I think leo won the stamina game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>God I wish I wasn't multi tasking<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bruh the edgeguards
BRUH
**BRUH**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I heard leo has an ike, lucina, and link
basically
he's me
but from mexico
and a professional<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>YOOOOOOOOO ZACKRAY'S ON A PRO CONTROLLER
YOOOOOOOOOO
I'M ROOTING FOR HIM NOW
LET'S GO ZACKRAAAAAAAAAAAY<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>I just root for Zack cause wolf is lit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nani
the fuck
was that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dabuz starting to play more aggressive
that means zackray is playing really well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>CMON ZACKRAY

<|start-block|>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>big ood<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in good news its snowing again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
i hope it snows enough for at least a delay
a snow day is obviously i deal
ideal<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gonna bet on a delay or cancellation and watch the rest of the tourney<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>same same
i was thinking earlier today
that a delay was better cause then theres not shitty added snow day
but a cancellation is totally better
cause we're seniors lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LMAO BYEEEEEEEE
ENJOY YOUR SHITTY 7TH PERIOD JUNIORS<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>the schedule next year will do that for me
winners finals<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then losers semis<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>j
k*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>god I just want dabuz out of this tournament
he plays his games so consistently
it's boring<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well zack still has a chance no
that was winner's semis<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then explain why leo's facing dabuz in losers<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nani the fuck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THAT WAS LOSERS FRAN<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
i cant read
okay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ZACK'S DONE
SOMEONE STOP DABUZ HE CAN'T WIN THE FIRST ULTIMATE SUPER MAJOR
LEO PLEAAAAAASE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>who we rootin for hoss
leo?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>whoever dabuz is against<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>who else is there<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>void samsora leo and dabuz<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im pretty chill with everyone but *big Dab*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo's got the most tools under his belt, the rest of them only  play one character<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>as much as i hate fighting lucina wathcing leo's lucina is pretty hyoe<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I feel like leo can win on character matchups, but the others can win on character mastery
void and samsora are the #1 of their chars
dabuz is dabuz
and leo's my hero
so I guess
LET'S GO LEO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ill just go with whoever's against dabuz
and if the time comes
ill pick a side
when the fuck is this next game
god why does 450 ml of water feel like so much less than 500<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it is exactly 10% less
imagine losing 10% off your grades
of course it feels like a lot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>11% depending how you look at it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>\/s<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this game will depend on how many openings samsora gets
if void plays perfectly and doesn't give him a single opening, he'll win<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>PoKéMoN sTaDiUm TwO iS aN eXcItInG sTaGe<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but if samsora gets ONE OPENING, pichu's dying
one downtilt and that's pichu's stock<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk why i thought void was cosmos lol
i was expecting an inkling
so i wasnt excited
but pichu is hype<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ooh that was a clean first stock<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause of *that*
nais
oof<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>PK THUNDER<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>PEE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>samsora had the chances<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>KAY\
THUNDERRRRRRRR<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>void got lucky<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just saw the cooler full of red bull LUL<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>void's playing impenetrable rn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>void's eyes lmao
but yeah samso just like
wasnt there
that game
cause there was no way in<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>samsora needs to figure out how to hit pichu
which is hard because nobody knows how to hit pichu
my character counterpick to pichu is ganon<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because if ganon hits pichu TWICE
pichu is dead<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that looks so badass
dtilt dair<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yup there it is
one mistake by void
that's the game
samsora's starting to adapt, and void is adapting back pretty hard
but sometimes he's juuuust a little slow on the uptake and it costs him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i respect void for tryna recover so aggressively so much
but its starting to cost him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>P
O
G
C
H

O
N<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>void played super well
samsora's combos just weren't working on pichu and it showed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he was only getting percent off of stray hits and random reads/ledgetraps<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but void made up for it with some pretty nutty edgeguards
good set<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo vs dabuz
CMON LEO
END THIS MAN<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lucina v olimar<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nah he's probably going ike<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dont get olimarred leo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gonna need to convert nairs as much as possible<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he was warming up with lucina<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mmm
olimar's got short arms
either one could work, honestly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he can yeet pikmin pretty well though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>depends on how aggressive dabuz plays
cuz olimar is def faster than ike<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>u were right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>heehee
ike
prepatch<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo won because he got 2 grabs and got like 46 percent because of them
ike is ez ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dair uair<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jesus the spacing on these guys<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is it just me or are all combos that start with a spike jut the sexiest<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah kinda
oof that was a mistake<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>big one
miscalculated the platform movement it seemes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo with the nair uair<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yo theys was some jiang jun style hitboxes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ike's flawless conversions
never fails<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>boy got hit before the sword connected<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OMAE WA
MOU SHINDEIRU<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>n a n i<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>GAME!<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wonder if they were inspired by that when they made the red flash<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yikes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dabuz will change from defensive to full aggression in a second
it catches people off guard all the time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I felt it
I was like
"he gon fsmash"
then
BAM
fsmash<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo was shook on that recovery<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well i got distracted after the first stock
and missed everythign lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo started making it back in SPADES
but lost it to a bad side b
I think it was just kalos
didn't give leo a place to do combos or recover
yeah dabuz banned yoshi triplats and bf
he def knows<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ladders
there you go<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>once more<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LADDERS
LET'S GO LEO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dabuz is dead<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WOOOOOOOOOO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>allahu akbar<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>all he needed was a platform
he got two kills and two recoveries off that platform<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>me love smashville<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the FUCKING LADDERS
AAAAAHHHHHHHH
they're so satisfying<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i like how when olimar gets hit really hard his helmet cracks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but they're really annoying to get hit by
like
the ladders are true combos
it's ridiculous<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah..<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but it FEELS SO GOOD TO HIT
cuz you be movin with this slow ass sword character
and you jump in the air like a fuckin elephant
and YOIGHT that big ass sword in the air
and draw a half circle
and they die at 80<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you want jump in the air like a fucking elephant?
have you seen me play bowser and dx3?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>boy I said elephant not godzilla<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>samsora vs leo rematch
let's see if leo learned anything<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so far no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>re rematch
why wouldnt leo try his luck with l ucina?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>need more guaranteed conversions I guess
tho he's on fd right now
so
idk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ha-CHA-- oh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>combos may not work against pichu
but ike<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oooh
that combo won him that game
solid stuff
now give leo platforms<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>does peach dtilt microspike you?
is that how it works?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>spikes.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so if you hit it on the ledge
they're dead<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhhh
trips
actually
trips<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dam<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmaoooooooooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he dun it a gain<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no fly zone<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they knoooooow better<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that was actually super well played by leo
no up b cheese and no platforms in the middle makes nerfs ike pretty hard<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what was that upsmash
*he says after it whiffs*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>woulda killed (maybe)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*fully aware that if hit he would be losing his mind*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>aight samsora wins on kalos the second time round
but now we're going to plats
so samsora has to win against ike with plats<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but not yoshi
thats a big nope for samso lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>both these players are playing at their peak<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bruh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if it aint broke
dont fix it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nah it is broke
fix it please<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sshhh
they did
just not fast enough<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>plats.
I saw the nair connect
"thats it"
GAME!<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo vs. void
I wonder if leo wants to go ike to keep his ez conversions or go luci to do better in neutral<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you really confused me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I would opt Ike because pichu will die to ike in only a few hits<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>when you said luci
for some reason i thought you were referring to lucario
i was so confused<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>luci
for
LuciarioTM
ike's a heavy boy but pichu's got godlike edgeguarding
but pichu's light as a feather, so he'll die at 60 from a nair uair<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah leo has a bit of a hard team reading his opponent for how to use his side b
that or samsora just knows him too well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dude that set with samsora was probably the highest level gameplay I've ever seen
both players were playing immaculately<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but one of them lost
and they both took damage
so
clearly not immaculate
:^)
holy shit
they're gonna have rivals of aether
at frostbit
h y p e<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they had rivals going this morning at genesis<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>w o t
thats lit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah I had it on the bg<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean
dont get me wrong smash is better
but rivals is fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rivals gets the title of "best smash game that's not a smash game"
hell I'd play it over brawl<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pms 2
leo's got his plats
is he gonna go ike
OOOH HE WENT LUCI<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he needs luci's speed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LET'S GOOO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its pichu<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HOOOH
I gotta try that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that was sexually arousing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ooooh up b buffered
that's like frame 3<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I like it
even though luci has less killpower
she still can outrange pichu easily
and leo's spacing is godlike
which'll probably be the deciding factor here
because luci's combos aren't gonna work on pichu
but she can win neutral exchanges here and t here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>aight that was pretty good
he got it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>love seeing a good yeet<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice stuff by void
took some risks and they paid off in SPADES
parry shieldbreaker > ftilt kill
dair spike
utilt uair down b
good shit
keep it uip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OH MY FUCKING GOD<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i honestly cant pick who to root for
im perfectly fine with either winning<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HOOOOOOOOOLY SHIT
THAT WAS THE HUGEST GAMBLE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this game is wild<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck me dude im getting sleepy as hecc

also it's snowing again
bless up
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hot
I gotta down air more as luci<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the fuckin spike combos<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo aint holding back
he's popping off<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leo is playing every advantage he has against void's pichu
if void doesn't pull something outta a magician's hat soon he's gonna win<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and that kids is why we dont dair too much
well i did anyway when i played marth lol but thats a whole nother matter<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>brother may I have some LOOPS<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>its a lil annoying but<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright void starting to gain some ground back<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>whacha gonna do about it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I feel like void needs to edgeguard better
but that's a tall order against luci<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HE DID IT AGAIN
THE MADMAN<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cant do that too much leo
improvise

<|start-block|>bruh im falling asleep
this is a terrible time to do that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bruh leo's broken 2 shields
and void's parried 2
anything's a go<|end-block|>

The Snow Day Prayer

Lord God up above 
Let me hear the words I love
As I sit here, this I pray:
That You will grant us a snow day

Send freezing rain and sleet and snow
So to school I cannot go
Let it pile ever deeper
As I tend to be a late sleeper
Early rising? Not my cup-a tea
I'd sleep 'till noon if t'were up to me!

Let me hear on the radio:
"No school today, too much snow"
Let it on the TV be seen:
"No school for kids who go to Skyleen"

Grant me now what I pray
And I'll try to make it to Church Sunday
All the students in this S.A.U.
Have put their faith and trust in You

In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
Grant us what we need the most
Please, O Lord, send snow and ice!
A break from school would be so nice!<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>alright
thanks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>seattle school district closed tommorow
so hopefully we are too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>started to snow again
at least fro me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>@here no school tomorrow you all probably know but<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WSU literally just called to me to announce they were delaying classes because of snow
like
*breathes in*
I DON'T EVEN FUCKING WANT TO GO TO YOUR SCHOOL
STOP ACTING LIKE I DO
OH MY FUCKING GOD YOU'RE SO ANNYOING<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what can i say
they're confident
its misplaced but still<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>2hr delay tomorrow
its
ambitious
that we'll be able to go to school<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ahreed
i can english
hey jason guess how i knew it was going to snow today as opposed to other days<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mmm
well you see
i looked out my window
saw like 10 inches of snow
looked at the road down from my house<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for me it was that
instead of saying snow
the forecast said rain
so naturally it had to snow
cause the forecast is always fucking wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean
so far
its been successful
until recently
then it shit all over itself<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it said it'd be snowing all weekend
it flurried for like 15 minutes at a time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we just need the forecast to say we will have a nice hot sunny clear day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also
my origin is vallyance<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so we getthe blizzard of a millenea<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah school happening tommorow is ambitious<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like
even if it does happen tomorrow
i wouldn be surprised
if i cannot go<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they are betting on the rain later today<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think i'd have to leave around 630
to guarantee getting there<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and it also not freezing over<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i guess they are
forecast says its supposed to get warmer
but like fran sad
maybe it'll be wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"2 hr delay"
SUUUURE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>20 hr*<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>magicalqliqui<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>two t's
yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk lifeline still seems pretty good to be
caustic feels good when you can set up the traps
but if you cant its a feels bad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lifeline is really good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>according to the people i watch
caustic is kinda bad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes buty<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he is finicky<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how else
am i supposed to promote eugenics<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my main gripe with lifeline is that you have to stand still to heal<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>than caustic<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but care package is nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also im busy spreading communism through turkey

<|start-block|>It's scary how fast Apex has taken over my friends list<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Is good game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I feel like just a week ago the game didn't exist but now 95% of my friends are either playing it or are about to play it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Sorry?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>It scares me
Like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>What kind of game takes over Lakeside, eSports, the class of 2020, AND Sky's server all at the same time?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Elbert even came out of the blue to tell me I should play it
THAT'S HOW SCARY IT IS
It's like a cult or something<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I haven't seen a game takeover like this since Fortnite
But this is on a magnitude I've never seen before
So needless to say, I'm intrigued about the game, but also very, very scared<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>What happens when I make an account and load up the tutorial? Do I get brainwashed?
WHO KNOWS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Yep
That's exactly it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im just ok with it
not mesmerized and addicted like a lot of people<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> you actually should play it
its a faster paced battle royale
where the gameplay is GOOD<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and my GPU is too shit for ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>or
you can play
hoi4
and create the pan atlantic worker's alliance<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I knew it was a fucking cult<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>elbert and i are on
come<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I DON'T HAVE THE GAME INSTALLED KEN
I DON'T EVEN HAVE AN ACCOUNT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>install it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this is peer pressure<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ur loss<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>holy
this game's got some powerful influence<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but I'll stand strong
probably until tomorrow when I get bored<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we need one more
sooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I nominate <@!189852772475207680><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im in game with party<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>SEE
IT'S SCARY
IF SOMEONE'S NOT ALREADY PLAYING THE GAME<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THEY'RE ABOUT TO START PLAYING<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>everyone is already playing
except for u<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there's some black magic sorcery bullshit going on and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its called being not gay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I've never seen Ken so adamant about getting me to play a game
he's obviously being controlled by something<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> calm down
it's just br
see now you're gonna get paranoid at my comments<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nonon
none of that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay then tell me
who's someone that's played the game and DOESN'T LIKE IT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think its just meh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no but like
not even meh
just
"not my thing, dropped"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but im trying to see if improving my skill will make me  like it
i know one person but you dont know them
so yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so then
how would I know
if the game's not controlling the minds of my friends
to convince me to play their game
and potentially get me controlled as well?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>welcome to alan is paranoid
episode 1
pilot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no TV network will pick up this show
bad script<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's like black mirror but way less interesting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ive never watched black mirrro
caues you know why?
i also think i'll get mind controlled
cause everyone has watched it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this game gets more fun as u get better
since everyone is trash<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's on origin huh
not off to a great start
well, then again, anything made by EA is not off to a great start but hey at least it's free<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya but you can gas people
like what more do you want from a game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya we memed it hella because it was from ea<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OKAY

<|start-block|>I haven't hadn't heard of this game until just this weekend, when it was topping Fortnite and League on the Twitch homepage, and 95% of my friends list was either **Playing Apex Legends** or about to.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>every single one of my friends who have tried the game have been playing it nearly non stop and also pushed me to give it a try as well
naturally, this would lead a normal person to the conclusion that it must be a really good game
but I am no normal person
I can see through the deception
something's going on here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fine alan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its decent man<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ill admit it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there's no way a game like this could come from nowhere and take over the internet by storm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>calm your shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Respawn gave me free crack
they said they'd keep supplying if i keep playing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>at least, not on its own
that is why
today
I'm jumping into the rabbit hole<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you know
you gotta do
the tutorial<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and I'm gonna find out what happened to my friends<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>before playing the game right
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>whether it kills me, or not
signed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like youre monologuing right now so that you can kill some poor dummy<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>**Apex Legends Journal Entry #0.1**
origin won't stop telling me that apex legends is up to date
I can't close the dialog box
does it know I'm trying to find out its secrets?
will investigate further<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 1: origin seems to be having what appears to be the digitized version of a stroke<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 2: game launched, saw a robot doing pushups and wondered "why does a robot need to do pushups"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because fuck you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 3: game has a borderless windowed option, so it's not completely trash<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 4: there's a lot of camera shake
like, action movie levels of camera shake<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ya
gotta get that
***INTENSITY***<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 4.5: my quake background told me to immediately turn the fov to the maximum
so I guess we're playing fisheye mode<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 5: the revolver from csgo is in the game
but this time it doesn't one-shot-kill people
like it did when it was first introduced<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 6: i found the railgun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 7: upon attempting to use lifeline's ult I crashed the training server<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>guess I'm doing the tutorial again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 8: that was literally the last part of the tutorial<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 9: pathfinder seems like he has mobility abilities
guess I'm maining him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>update 10: I think I have reached the point where friendship is required

<|start-block|>hemlok SUCKS
did you really not find a better gun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hemlok is ok
put it on single fire tho
that things a mad man<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not necessarily
put it on single fire and use it mostly for ranged engagement
my team just landed in a super hot spot
and i was laying into this bangalore with my fist
i woulda killed her
but the dumb biatch picked up a purple shield smh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!145664386021720064> i woulda definitely taken a longbow over the hemlok though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but
400 ammo
is a lot
almost too much<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yep
i had gold backpack<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oH<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i HAD 560 reserve ammo
and like almost another hundred in my extended mags
but my teammate wanted some of it
for their hemlok
spitfire with purple extended mag has a 60 round mag
its kinda ridiculous
especially if youre capable of hitting people
unlike myself<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright boys
what are we looking forward to<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>botw 2<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>info on fire emblem three houses is already confirmed
(tbh I would totally shill out for a botw 2)
I wanna see something about animal crossing
maybe smash DLC
I don't think there's gonna be a huge announcement like a new first party game in the works
but three houses and animal crossing, and smash dlc as cream on the cake
that's what I'm looking forward to
with ~35 minutes, I'm guessing 5-10 is devoted to FE
so the remaining 25-30 minutes is up in the air
either way, I'm stoked to see what nintendo's got up their sleeves to wrap up q1 2019<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but I'm not expecting too much since nintendo likes releasing their biggest titles either around holiday season or a product launch
(smash was released in dec, botw was a switch day 0)
I'm guessing they're aiming to release AC/FE around dec as well
but that's all speculation
soooo
yeah
oh and I guess they'll announce something and it'll be
"Available to play starting TODAY"
and we'll all lose our minds or something<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>**-------------------------------------------------**
anyways, now let's talk about what we DON'T want to see
please don't fucking announce minecraft steve as smash dlc
I would literally become depressed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>please announce minecraft alex as smash dlc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yamero
please don't talk about the smash NA open
because nobody is taking that seriously<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>please announce generic roblox man as smash dlc
please announce generic lego man as smash dlc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I don't want but expect 10-15 minutes of the direct to be focused on 3ds and indie titles
I respect that nintendo is still releasing games on the 3ds
but I think we both realize that everyone who wants a portable gaming console just has a switch now
now that I think about it
we might hear about a remaster
uhhh
let's see
a Zelda remaster wouldn't be too out of left field
there's plenty of those and porting them from the WiiU to the switch isn't ridiculous
they're not gonna fucking release melee hd
get over it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes they will
nintendo listens to the people<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nintendo doesn't listen
I don't think they even have ears<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sorry i forgot my /s<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well scratch that
they DO have ears
just that
they can only understand japanese<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they dont listen to their eirs OpieOP<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so western complaints don't have as much impact<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is it the west mostly asking for melee hd?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well I haven't heard of japan wanting it
wait does japan still have a melee community?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dont ask me brother<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>according to this
no not relaly
anyways
okay lemme redo my prediction about the direct
**35 minutes total**
first 10-15 minutes on indie/3ds titles
next 3-5 on online/software updates and fixes
5 minutes on titles we actually care about
then the last 10-15 on FE 3 houses
that's my prediction<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>obviously leaves a lot to be desired, but this is nintendo we're talking about, and in February at that, so I'm not expecting any mega viral shit like the first Smash Ultimate teaser<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> where you going
come here bois<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>already squadded ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what the<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what the
H E C K<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we've got an open slot
<@!145664386021720064> <@!189852772475207680> any of you on?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>At oscars house lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>boop?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wanna play like one game
but then i should go
MAYBE 2 but its not likely<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the y open today ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>NAGGA<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>of course depends how long it goes on
yeah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gotta be there 4-7 ?
but that means that first i have to remove the snow from around my car
so that i can get it ouy ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i will be on later<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so uh
since its likely school is tomorrow
we have a show tomorrow<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have work tomorrow too :/<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im gonna eat real quick<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!111635656479952896> are you playin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they announced a fucking tetris battle royale game
fuck apex I'm boutta DROP some of these kids in tetris<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>where
we
placing
boys
also yes <@!145664386021720064><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok i won 2 more games
im not as bad now <@!189852772475207680><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pog<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Nice
Pog indeed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>both tiems i got 8 kills<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yay 2 hour delay
i thought it was gonna be regular<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just wait
its gonna dump snow
overnight
and fuck over everything<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the forecast says nothing gonna happen
so in effect you are correct<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>^ is 2 degrees right now so that's unlikely

Also, all these snow days so we only have 5 days of school in 2 weeks and then next week is midwinter break
Fucking lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!105508293522264064> ?
do you have to be quiet or what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>stats dont matter when all you need is an r301 and a peacekeeper
best weapon combo in the game
prove me wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>theyre good because of the stats tho<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there are some weapons that have higher dps
but i mean
recoil is pretty much
*negligible*
see the r301 recoil
might as well change that to
"gives you aimbot doesn't matter"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>w/ decent stock ye
hope we get and updated one eventually
for upgrades and crap<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i hope they buff the kraber to just win the game
i think that would really make the game
iNtErEsTiNg<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kraber seems fine as is
but its fairly rare so i imagine its hard to get data on<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>easiest clap in my life<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah that really was
r99 plus wingman
espicy meataballa<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i got prowler plus hop up<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>To yeet, or not to yeet--that is the question:
Whether 'tis danker in the mind to yeet
The slings and arrows of dank fortune
Or to yeet arms against a sea of troubles
And by yeeting end them. To yeet, to yeet--
No more--and by a sleep to say we yeet
The heartache, and the thousand dank shocks
That flesh yeets heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to yeet yeeted. To yeet, to yeet--
To yeet--perchance to yeet: ay, there’s the rub,
For in that sleep of death what dreams may yeet
When we have yeeted off this dank coil,
Must yeet us pause. There yeets the respect
That yeets calamity of so dank life.
For who would yeet the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor yeets wrong, the dank man's contumely
The pangs of dank love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That dank merit of th' dank takes,
When he himself might his quietus yeet
With a dank bodkin? Who would fardels yeet,
To yeet and yeet under a dank life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The dank country, from whose bourn
No traveller yeets, yeets the will,
And makes us rather yeet those ills we yeet
Than yeet to others that we yeet not of?
Thus conscience does yeet cowards of us all,
And thus the dank hue of resolution
Is yeeted o'er with the dank cast of thought,
And enterprise of dank pitch and moment
With this regard their currents yeet dank
And yeet the name of action. -- Soft you now,
The dank Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons
Yeet all my sins yeeted.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Okay Google fucked that link a little but please Google the urban dictionary for yeet
It's gold<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>please don't click that link it's horrendous<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jason already showed us this *two days* ago<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WELL EXCUSE ME FOR BEING OUT OF THE FUCKING COUNTRY FRAN<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how is your late afternoon<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Oh
Riiiiiiiiight<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's a lie I had a VPN the entire time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Lemme get you a picture of where I'm at right now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>woah
im busy studying for my IB test
<@!110137446053736448> you get a new GPU/ fix your crashing issue?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gpu arriving friday
im just looking at skins rn
finally turned fps counter on
get 90 in the armory with full low settings monkaS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>which gpu<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a 1070<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>very good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for $330<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what are you on right now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rx 290
i think
some old hunk o' hardware
i bought off ken like 2 years ago<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>damn rx 290?
what is that like
2013?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no clue<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think its 2013<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>some of these weapon skins are
*hoo*
*oh baby*
but the other 90% are<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my two legendary mozambique skins are the <:displeasure:513948545267793924> kind<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh my god you have two legendary mozambiques<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yessir<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my legendary skins are for gibraltar, lifeline and g7 scout<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i very much like my legendary prowler skin though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>g7 scout one is very nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>which one'd you get
please dont be either of the dragon ones<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the really bright orange one with dragon art
so yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ahh you got scammed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its alright<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's a hidden purple
mark my words
idk, i dont feel like they integrated the dragon well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the gibraltar one i got is a scam<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it doesnt feel like part of a desgn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ride or die<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just like it got tacked on
that gibraltar one seems kinda memey but at least it changes his model significantly
*cough* second 2 legendary lifeline skins *cough*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sixth sense caustic is Kreygasm quality right there
makes me wanna play caustic
not that i dont want to already<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Is here :D<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i cant install it yet ?
theres some cable i need to get
i think its the power supply connection
on my old card and the cable i have available has 6 square connecty things
the new card has 8
also the cable i hae aint long enough
big sad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye ye
u can use it with 6 temporarily for now if u want
all it will do is fans wont go ham
and u may reach some performance issues<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>again
cable not long enough
cant reach around<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but even with 6 pins it will be fine
LOL
wait
what psu do u have<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wot
wot that
usp?
er ups
idk wtf its called<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh psu
i see
um
idk
some
thing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>make sure its enough watts
to support everything in your computer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk which it is though :/<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fok is a change in graphics card gonna force me to revamp everything?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it could<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>:S<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not really though
most cass
cases<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>still
yikers<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you just gotta chekc
everythin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just put the damn computer back together PepeHands<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>take a pic of ur psu<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the means i need to open my comp back up PepeHands<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>recommended PSU for the card is 500W
my PSU says ATX-TL 500W-BK
so i think im good?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lets just hope it doesnt explode<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well first i need to get an 8-pin power adapter that's long enough<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok ken
<@!105508293522264064> you sure that the 8-pin can work with a 6-pin?
i've managed to stretch the cables around so it can fit now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!105508293522264064> i dont wanna ruin my new boy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>KENNETH
RESPOND<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what if you just dont<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dont what
risk it?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dont do that
and just wait<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cause i want new card now ?
and that's why im waiting for an answer
if its okay then ill try it
and its not like reduced power will ruin my card, no?
if jst for a test run<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>prob the best case scenario is that it runs underclocked
my guess is it just might not turn on
but no permanent problems<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hm
do i try it?
i want a reply
from one more person
to break the tie
my vote doesnt count<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im tryna find info on my current PSU but the closest i get is ebay sales of it with no real information on ti<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>reading into things apparently my PSU is made by lying scum and its probably not actually a 500W PSU
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you know what isnt made by lying scum
the russian democratic coalition for the furtherment of all<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>brah
i hate<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we have expanded our borders
to include
ukraine
finland
japan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i didnt realize PSUs would be so cheap ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mongolia
turkestan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it will work fine
no damages<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk about work fine
based on what im reading
no damages i can understand<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the only issue might come from ur gpu underperforming on high intensive games
but u will see drastic improvement even with a 6 pin
i just realized i run my rx 580 with 6 pin even though it needs a 8 pin
and i have done that for a solid 2 years<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what psu you got
im just afraid that my psu isnt actually 500W<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well
here goes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>That failed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>This is infinitely annoying<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>aw man reggie is retiring<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my dad ordered a cable that adapts 6-pins  to 8-pins
arrives saturday, we'll see if it works<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>We're in business boys<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>great now we can play
without your internal screeching of crashing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>We'll see about that
If my PSU is 500W like it says in the name then probably yeah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Also I have to install 105GB of driver stuff at about 30kB/s
F<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kb?
wtf<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeet
now im getting just under 1% of the download per minute
20% in boysh
its downloading AORUS graphics engine
part of the package i assum
so i can change the color of the gigabyte logo on the card OMEGALUL<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>correction, more like half a percent per minute
<:displeasure:513948545267793924><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Yeah so
Now when I try to play games
My computer shuts off
So I need a new PSU probably<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Update: so far, if I use low settings, my computer remains turned on
With buttery smooth frames<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Update: nevermind
It just takes longer to turn off
:S<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>You can try underclocking your gpu until a new psu arrives<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>To make it intentionally draw less power<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Also I just got back and am all sorts of jetlagged<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and we have our first monday in over a month
for school<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and its snowing on the plateau<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you lie<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>some spots in light<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i swear to god
if some stupid shit cancels school tommorow
this has got to be a record
for consecutive mondays of no school<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its prob not cold enough for ice
so its fine hopefully<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's gonna be below freezing over night
soooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bet
also fran
do what alan said
u need to tinker with the power draw till u find the sweet spot
aka the guess and check method<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay
so
when before it would shut off for even opening Apex
reducing the boost clock from 1700 MHz to 1585 MHz (the minimum) made it survive apex training mode for 7.5 minutes
without turning off
not that it turned off at that point
i exited the game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!105508293522264064> <@!478706068223164416> does reducing the memory clock do anything? i'm assuming no, just dont max out the memory usage, but i did it just in case
so this is promising while i wait on a new PSU<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats prob good
i think u should lower the voltage as well imo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?
i lowered the target power consumption to 75% as well
dunno if that actually does anything but hey<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> where the nig are you<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>the most useful thing i did today was get a haircut
i have 2 IAs due within the week
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i love me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>world religions is due on monday
you'll be fine
my bio IA is due wednesday<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my physics IA is due *sometime soon*
i have to retake my data wednesday morning though
so i can do just about
nooothing till then<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>retake data?
damn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>she didnt say anything about my data
its just the data i got is pretty much unusable
and i think i could get better data
but who knows it could be worse lmao
i was gonna retake the data *3 mondays ago* but i think you know what the problem was htere<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mmm yes
we had to finish our data over a month ago except for people working with bacteria
who they had to wait for it
so they get extensions<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if i had the afternoon off and focused and got my data in the morning
i'd be able to do the whole physics IA in 2 days (the day before to come up with the idea and get shit)
bit in bio you have to grow shit right
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
you can do an experiment, analyzing databases or running a simulation<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im basically gonna be doing 60% of my WR IA in a couple dies Pepega<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the vast majority do experiments but it doesnt have to involve growing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh the physics IA has the same options<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>could be with human subjects, analyzing cell processes, etc.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the way fowler explained it was basically like we *had* to do an experiment<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah same with gillespie
some people did do databases though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i did something with growing though
but it was analyzing *the process of growing* i.e. germination<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hgmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh boy march 1st-15th
ooooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>**screaming**
no no I'm okay I'm cool
not that I can do anything about it at this point anyways<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the selective service sent me a letter
and I originally thought<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh my<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"oh I guess I have to stop procrastinating on my registration"
but then I opened it
and it said
"if you changed your info, update it pls"
I was like
what info
what
I never registered
I go online and look up my registration
and
apparently
I was registered LAST YEAR
AND I WAS TOLD NOTHING OF IT
WHAT THE FUCK
so I guess that's my annoyance of the day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>did you get a driver's license<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there you go<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nearly two years ago
but it said
it registered me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>renew it?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THREE MONTHS AGO
a year ago<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you 18 yet?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>completely legal<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>turn 18 3 months ago?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>2 months and a half<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tada
there you go<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*nani*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i dont think i registered too but i havent gotten anything from the government telling me to sign up
and i've been 18 for 5 months
so i guess i am<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>``` In an effort to ensure compliance with federal law among young men, many states and territories, and the District of Columbia, have enacted legislation which links Selective Service registration with the process of applying for a driver’s license, renewal, or state identification card. As a result of such legislation, in May 2002, the state of Delaware, which enacted driver’s license legislation in 2000, became the first state to reach nearly 100 percent registration compliance since Selective Service began compiling this data. In that same year, seven other states increased their compliance rates by 3 percent or more after enacting similar driver’s license legislation.```
that process is in like
40ish states now?
washington included iirc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nani the FUCK
can they really just
*yeet*
me into ss?
I mean<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```Also, men who fail to register with Selective Service are not eligible for certain programs and benefits that Congress and most states and territorial legislatures and the District of Columbia have linked to registration. They include student loans and grants for college, government jobs, and job training. Additionally, immigrant men residing in the U.S. who failed to register when they were at least 18 years old, but not yet 26 years old, may be denied U.S. citizenship by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if the FBI was gonna come after my ass<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they can do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sure I was gonna comply<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a lot if youre not registered for ss<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but isn't everyone a little hesitant
to sign up for a program
named
the
**SS**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
because people dont usually call it the SS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well
it's there in the name
**S**elective **S**ervice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like you know when you got your license
and they ask you if you intend to sign up for selective service<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck that was two years ago<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yea<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats you agreeing for them to give your info to the selective service<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm just trying to make the point<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and theyll just register you when you're of age<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that
S
S<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>reminds me a hell of a lot of<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its also the same acronym as secret service<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it will be interesting to see how it works for women now
cause they have to sign up for the draft at 18 now
but everyone who got a license won't have given their info over yet afaik
wonder how many people just
wont<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what if I just move
to
Costa Rica<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you mean like
get a dual citizenship?
or just abandon your USA citizenship<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i believe its based on citizenship?
so it doesnt matter if you're not physically in the US
if you want a US citizenship you need to sign up for the draft<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>MELEE NOT AT EVO 2019
COMMUNITY IN SHAMBLES<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>d e ed
replace with brawl please<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>senior superlatives poll is up
I say we vote Elbert Cheng for best athlete<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yse
yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that is
too many categories
for me to care anymore<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just vote elbert for best athlete
and maybe alex park for best eyes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like i guess i dont have to vote in all of them
but fuck thats a waste of time
i could be playing minecraft instead<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>JUST IMAGINE THE BACKLASH IF ELBERT WON BEST ATHLETE THOUGH
IT WOULD BE THE FUNNIEST SHIT
and good marketing for esports
mr. director of communications<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok and you see
they probably will look at the results
and change them accordingly?
like didnt they pull the facebook polls down because people didnt take them seriously?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nobody takes this seriously
actually
no
better response
who takes this seriously
there are categories like'
"going to be a plateau parent"
"highest snapchat score"
"most selfies"
if someone's taking this seriously they have their priorities out of wack<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan
we
are in high school
who has their priorities straight<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there are a few joke categories below my political party's voting groups
like for instance
samyak is the nominee for best FOA<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh YES
best FOA in history is the very 1st one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tell that to the white people running the facebook polls<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nate's only half
keep the record straight ken<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nate wasnt running them<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well he's a facebook group admin
just making sure<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>all the white people got pissed at us IB kids that we essentially took over the polls
but that aint stoppin shit
your gonna see ib kids and only ib kids as the nominees<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ken the fact that you're referring to them as the "white kids" is sending off red flags<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol
im not wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there was quite a bit of drama that came out of the polls lol
like for best girl friends and shit lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well obvs
it's basically the first version we're seeing of a political vote
parties are already forming<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and I think it's the most fascinating shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they have already been formed a while ago<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no but like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lets just say the cohort<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>actual
organized
voting
political parties<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>will forever be number one
u think that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>with nominees and stuff<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but look at the clubs
the cohort
literally has control of more than half of the clubs
we got dyuthi
to be the fucking president of nhs
and he was meming around
the cohort literally just said fuck u all and picked him
it was kinda funny<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're making it sound like "the cohort" is a corrupt political machine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we are
im not denying it
being part of it has its benefits
and we have different sub sections of it to lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look
I'm not saying that it's wrong to have alliances
that's just how things work
but admitting that your team is legitimately  corrupt is not the best lookm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>literally all ib cohort was supposed to be a ib group chat
and then we all turned it into a giant meme
i mean idgaf
its literally a giant gc where everyone is dying from ib<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wouldn't necessarily call it a political group in the sense that we intend to take over skyline
but like it just happened
like accidently
the group slowly got bigger and bigger
u should come to one of our "meetings"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you know it sounds like you're inviting me to a cult<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its prob going to happen when uw comes out<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'll have you know I'm an upstanding christian man kenneth<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol
all the NS chats
are lifesaving too
ib brings people together
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>*and crushes their souls*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>;_;<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cough what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but together
we die together<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but ibcp just kinda looks at dip while eating breakfast
"that looks bad"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ikr
we are own gang
the better gang
the one and only
best gang<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THE NEW POKEMON GAME IS ANNOUNCED
HOLLLY SHITTT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol
i love cp
also
why give retards control of an important event
you dont give the kid with down syndrome the nuclear launch codes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but we elected trump president<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Dont forget Pokémon Gun<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>that future release better come out ***tonight***
y'know what be nice?
if adding additional asterisks past 3 would increase the degree of italicization
and bolding
at 10 asterisks it'd be completely illegible, just a white blob
but still **********beautiful**********
wtf^

thats
what

10 asterisks just does 2 italicized asterisks

how the fuck do you cite a line in shakespeare
is it
(act, scene, line)
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also moral dillemma
I wanna cite the book of genesis
because reasons
and right now the source I have is Wikipedia
now
the issue is
I don't want to cite Wikipedia because I'll get marked down for it, despite it probably being generally accurate and good enough for my purposes
but then again
it has about as much credibility as any other book of genesis online
so
like
who the fuck cares
lemme just cite christianmingle.com for my source<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and
and
is it offensive
to refer to the Book of Genesis with the same angle
as literary fiction
as you would to Frankenstein, Hamlet, or The Reader?
or would you refer to it as Non Fiction
or Something Inbetween?

anyone mind giving me a hand
cause im lost as shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!189852772475207680> did some of that in his<|end-block|>

halp plez?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we need 1<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do you have like
infinite slots or whatever?
ill play apex<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>basically <@!110137446053736448>
for mine
i used config files]<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>information would be saved to a text doc
i would READ the text doc in the location i need<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is this this internal storage crap im reading about<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sortof
are you using the android guide<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im using whatever the fuck is least confusing
sometimes its that
other times not so much
they're like "write this shit"
but they dont say where
or really say how itll interact with the rest of the app<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
File f = new File(this.getFilesDir(), "hello.txt");
```
then<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so is hello the filename<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!189852772475207680> GET IN<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im updating origin
gosh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>use dynamodb<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>@wen fuck you
christ what is going on<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then in the activity you want to call it again
declare the file, if it existws
if the file exists, create a fileinputstream
```java
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f);
```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so i can create the file in whatever activity i want
and it will be legible in all of them><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes but you should probably have a<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if i check the directory<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>IF (f.exists());
or something
yes you just have to declare it
how i did my configuration is changing the filename based on the instance i was in<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>If f.exists dont create another f<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>> write files using `FileOutputStream`<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you dont keep remaking the file every time you open the app<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>orrr use dynamodb<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>> read files using `FileInputStream`<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you could do that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>shut up ken
fuck off starbot
god I hate you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont wanna fuck with the cloud kenneth<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its much easier thooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is it really
truly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also is it necessary to save shit to the cloud for a task organizaion app<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its like click click click<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like really<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then click
thats it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kenneth that makes no sense<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> <@!189852772475207680> do you suggest creating the file for the first time in main activity's oncreate
??????????<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>depends<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im want die<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if the file exists
then ur gonna override it accidently<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i would just do 
```java
if (file.exists())  {
    do nothing lol;
} else {
    create the file;
}
```
so how would i create and manage arraylists and whatnot through this
?? :))
im want die
<@470822754262712329> is you want die?
you is want die<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fran
```
if (!file.exists) {
    do thing;
}
```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh
uhh
yeah
u rite
if this doesnt kill me today
i will probably start asking about how i make my displays show information from these files
but that comes at a later date<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im tryin real hard to get rid of my squiggles (squiggles "italicized" for effect)
```java
File dataStorageFile;
if(!*dataStorageFile*.exists){
       dataStorageFile = new File(this.getFilesDir(), "dataStorageFile");
}
```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it says that it hasnt been initialized
because it hasnt
but would that just always make it make a new file on app start?
if i dont do File dataStorageFile, then it just cant resolve the symbol
logically
i dont know how else to go about it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no no
so lets say File f = new File(whatever) right
if there is no ACTUAL file in the designated location
like the text document doesnt actually exist
then file.exists() would return false
i think
your declaration is just the statement that there is a file object
so set it to a value, then check if it exists<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wouldnt that rewrite the file each time you open the app though?
like if i said it equaled null
or something
or 5 idfk
then each time you open the app it would rewrite the file to null or 5, no?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lets say I opened your app for the first time
i create some data, save it to a file
then i close the app
the file will still exist even through the app's death<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you want to delete the file, you have to have some sort of process to wipe the entire folder
you could do f.delete();<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im just concerened that if i do File data = 3<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but youd have to do that for every file you have<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then if( blah blah make the file)
then everytime i open the pap
it overrides the data<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it wont override the data<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>beacuse its going data = 3<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the declaration of your file
is just to tell java
"hey this is a thing, do something with it"
it doesnt actually write data to it, you have to have bufferedreader and fileoutputstream for that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okeh
me trust<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just play around with it
also im assuming youre not automatically writing data everytime you open the app<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hm
no
just if the interact with the tasks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye then it should work<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay
even if i initialize as `File data = null`
cause if i just hit 1 it gets angry<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well when youre declaring a file you just tell it the location and name<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>to write data you need to initialize fileoutputstream to give the file data (or im misunderstanding your question)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not to write data into it
if in my onCreate for my main actiity
i do this:<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
File dataStorageFile = null;
if(!dataStorageFile.exists()){
    dataStorageFile = new File(this.getFilesDir(), "DataStorageFile.txt");
}
```
will it fuck up my data storage every time i open it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that would just never create the new File would it
fuck me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well i mean that would never create your file yeah
because your file technically doesnt exist when its declared<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!189852772475207680> the next game<|end-block|>

holy shit 1,500 spacces

jesus christ<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>holy shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright so I have this denim shirt I bought from HK
right
and today was the first day I needed to wash it
I read the label just before I put it in the machine
"warning: product dye stains light colored material. prevent prolonged contact with car seats, light clothing, etc."
so I'm like
well okey doke I'll just hand wash this bitch
I fill up the sink with water and a scrumptious dose of detergent
and dunk that baby in there
and boy howdy
did this boy RUN
and when I say RUN
I'm not talking about
a dozen sleep deprived ninth graders running redhawk neighborhood at 8 am
I'm talking
usain bolt is coming after you with a chainsaw kinda run
so anyways
I dunk the thing in there
and BAM
blue
I'm like
okay I expected some color to com-NANI THE FUCK IS THIS
I look down at the fucking sink and I can't see my fucking hands under what now looks like grape gatorade
to be fair this is a pretty dark washed denim shirt
like as dark as you can get without having the n word pass kinda dark
but THIS
I was not prepared for the god of blue to descend upon my humble bathroom sink
so I squeeze my jacket
and boy did I squeeze
I squeezed like my admission to UW required I squeeze
and the water got DARKER
if you bottled this shit up in a gatorade bottle and handed it to me you'd poison me 10/10
so I'm standing above a sink of wet denim, gatorade, and bubbles
thinking to myself
"shit, how am I gonna get this outside?"
because I am not gonna risk putting this thing in the dryer with the rest of my white t-shirt collection
now, the thing you gotta know about my house
is that it's mostly carpeted
white carpet, at that
so I'm sitting there squeezing the everloving fuck out of my hong kong denim jacket
trying to come up with a plan that won't make it seem like a blueberry pie was bleeding out onto my carpet for half an hour
so I squeeze
and I squeeze
TRYING to get the dye to stop bleeding
but it never does
so I drain the sink
refill it with water
squeeze some more
repeat about twice or thrice
and decide
"okay I'm just gonna do it"
so I YEET that motherfucking shirt outta the sink
after squeezing out most of the gatorade
and find a coathanger
I make it outside at the expense of my fingers which are now dyed a blue not unlike that which you'd find on a dead person
so we're outside
soggy denim shirt
coathanger
and a porch with lots of sunlight
I hang it up and go back inside, right?
WRONG
we forgot a mission critical item here
> a clothesline
so I'm sitting there
a dumbfuck on a sunny day on his porch
holding a wet shirt
looking for somewhere to hang it
and keep in mind
I live in a suburb
so like
my porch is visible to pretty much anyone
so I gotta hang this shit up before some random 5th grader come and gawks their brace-filled toothy little mouth at me in my summer short shorts
I look around at my porch
and see
EXCEPT
a windchime
a chinese windchime
has characters on it
chimes in the wind
you know, the standard ordeal
but this was PERFECT
so I hippity hop to it
and hang my wet shirt
from a windchime
and go back inside
and that's the story of the last 10 minutes of my life<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Is the shirt even blue anymore?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it looks darker than what I started with
there was no signs of it stopping<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so i finally took that politcal compass test
and i always thought i was a *little* right
turns out im a *little* left<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>god why're you so negative<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i mean leftists believe in gov't
to solve people's problems
i dont really<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk why im so negative<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Western just sent me an acceptance packet without ever properly receiving my transcripts from me ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its more that
you're more right than a lot of people here<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i am
im afraid to expose it<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Quite indeed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>isn't it kinda strange that water just kinda falls from the skies sometimes
imagine explaining that to someone
"yeah around here sometimes water falls from the sky"
"you're joking me"
"no it's actually a thing"
"wouldn't that cause huge problems for like literally everyone"
"sometimes it does, but usually people prepare for it"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>There are planets where it rains diamonds<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"and you're telling me people just kinda deal with it"
"you betcha"
"don't you guys get wet or something? couldn't you drown?"
"yeah we get wet, but there's not nearly that much water falling down all at once"
"how much falls every time?"
"like, imagine no more than about half the density of a shower"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"that still sounds like a lot"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"well it can vary a lot, sometimes the droplets are super tiny and kinda float around so it doesn't really feel like it's falling, and sometimes they're as big as golf balls and are really noisy"
"seriously?"
"yeah, and if it's cold enough, the droplets can freeze"
"so like, literal solid ice falls from the sky?"
"no not like, solid solid ice, like, water that's frozen but like not hard"
"not hard frozen water?"
"uh yeah, well actually, sometimes it becomes hard"
"couldn't someone die from that? like if they were hit in the head?"
"well it's super rare for the droplets to get above anything bigger than a pellet, but some areas might see ones as big as baseballs"
"and people die from those?"
"I could see it happening"
"earth sounds rough"
"honestly it is"
"water falling from the sky at random, sometimes becoming large enough to kill you"
"yessiree"
"and you're all somehow still alive"
"yeah I don't get it either"<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>**Starbot Update 5/5/19**
- If Starbot gets stuck in purgatory (i.e. you disconnect him from a voice call using the right-click context menu command) you can use !getout to bring him back to the land of the living (get him unstuck and allow him to rejoin the call)
- The !play command now makes Starbot join the voice call if he's not already in it, similar to how !lofi and !bitch already worked
- The !play command will now clear the queue, skip the current song, and start playing the track instead of just queuing the track and skipping one song
- The !play and !queue commands can now search for songs on YouTube if given something other than a URL to play from (the first result from a YouTube search given your query gets queued)
- Starbot will now disconnect from a voice call if nobody plays anything for 10 seconds (this is to cut down on the times where Starbot sits alone in a call overnight because someone forgot to tell him to leave)<|end-block|>

K<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Link has recovery options, and a lot of options for lots of situations
That might be why
But he does gets rushed down<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>He just doesn't get results cause he's a link and is too technical

ben used to as well<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have one too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Is it good?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes but if you get the i7 or i9 versions, you should undervolt cpu and repaste it. the pasting job dell does is ass.
the xps has bad cpu/thermal throttling problems<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sticking an i9 in that design is not very optimal<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also there are some quality issues it seems cause ben's was so busted, he had to ship it back
ive had mine for a month and nothing bad has happened<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it is very good for just work<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>SKREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETATATATATA<|end-block|>

FUCK my laptop is slow
i should sell this garbage and get a new one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I spent like 3 months grinding college apps nonstop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>same<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in that time I developed an aversion to Cambria<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i spent like
a solid week on my essay
was lit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I've gotten over it now, but for a while I flinched whenever I saw it
CAMBRIA<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thsi is what you meen rite?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not quite but good try<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it has probably been 3 minutes
discord has yet to open on my laptop
fml<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it took TWELE minutes for this shitty laptop to boot up and open discord
TWELVE
the SHIT i go through for you pepple<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it says 5 "versions" its more of drafts. the reason i call it versions though is because if i made a new draft and it was *worse* than an old one i would just go back to a previous version (i never did, but i had it as an option)
so, dont delete drafts
start a new document, copy the old draft in, and then revise<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>or just do what i did where you denote where one draft ends, copy it, paste it after the marking, then revise the copied draft<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh ok

<|start-block|>CAESSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAR<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you know
when youre reading frans essay
and then you read your own
and then you read them both again
"these are saying the same thing fuck"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we are one and the same
this is why i love you
and not myself
:^)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my original plan
was to write something like alan
but alan's is so particular
AND OUR CONTEXT
IS SO SIMILAR
IM WRITING ABOUT BEING A TAEKWONDO INSTRUCTOR
AND YOU WROTE ABOUT BEING A SWIM INSTRUCTOR<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh fuck
oh shit
yes but whats your hook quote
is it like mine?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>work in progress
currently
its<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if the context situation is similar it doesnt matter much<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>"the moment you think you can't will become the moment you truly can't"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats only kinda similar<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>true<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>depends how you develop it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>youre writing about "keep going"
im writing about "don't give up" (keep going)
ok fran
tell me what i have so far
is NOT similar<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh its similar<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>While other students were practicing their kicks with another instructor, I pulled my student to the side to help him perfect one of the most difficult kicks in our school’s style of Taekwondo. I watched my student’s frustration gradually build up, until he finally gave in to the feeling of defeat. He had lost sight of his formidable goal, but I hadn’t. As he repeated that succeeding was impossible, I lowered myself down to his height and put my hand on his right shoulder.
“The moment you think you can’t will become the moment you truly can’t.”
It took him a few seconds to understand what I had spoken, but it convinced him to try again a few more times, eventually accomplishing what he thought was impossible. As my student beamed feelings of accomplishment and excitement, he reminded me of how that sentence—always heralding a surge of determination—helped me through my own challenges.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>put it back in codespeak<|end-block|>

```<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its more distinct<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>theres some similarity for sure<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THATS WHAT IM SAYING<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the way you're presenting it makes it feel different from mine
imo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah im using my writing style<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like mine's about continuing to improve by finding challenges<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>which is like
a shadow of alan's<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yours is about not backing away from challenge
yes they're similar
but they're still distinct
also yours is hella wordy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WORK
IN
PROGRESS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that aint gon fly real soon
500 words is absolutely fucking nothing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have 2 months to fix it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just keep it in mind
start removing wordiness as soon as possible to save yourself a headache later
what's it at now?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>153<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>30% of your budget
for less than 30% of the message
imo
uh
good luck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dude how do i write this
IM LITERALLY
SAYING LIKE
i hate stagnation
therefore to grow I naturally sought out challenges
WHAT IS THIS
but sometimes challenges put me in a dark place
but that's why they're called challenges<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its a toughie<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>after im done tho
im gonna get EVERYONE to revise it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but hold this thought: do they really need to know that challenges put you in a dark palce for you to get your message out, or is it just a play for more words/some details to make your challenge seem more significant?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>probably a gray area there<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it feels unnecessary to me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i kinda but kinda dont need it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kinda need it most likely means you're using it as a connecting point to another tohught
what's the other thought<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the other thought is like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tougher challenges require stronger determination to spark larger growth basiclaly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hm, going from "some challenges put me in a dark place" to that seems to me like just adding "but these tougher, deeper challenges foster more growth", at least to me.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah basically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you wanna develop that more, you might needer a better segway
i think
if you dont wanna i guess it could be all right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i probably should<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it'd depend on the rest of the essay though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this essay is literally all or nothing for uw<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i know the feeling<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>3.6 GPA

<|start-block|>ima be at home
all day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh
wait what happened to the engineering launch <@!110137446053736448>
anyways hint<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i never said yes yo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>BUT FRAN
I'LL MAKE JAVA OOLONG<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>n y e t<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hint
uh
every line is terminated by a `\r\n` sequence<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh so youre starting a new line?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no I meant the numbers file
it's a hint about the data set and how you should be thinking about it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so far
we have array
nio
read/write takes a long time
and numbers should be terminated by a line feed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>have you figured out what nio is yet<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its a file input output system
that allows both to happen simultaneous
or as data is being processed
iirc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait this is kinda insane though
8 threads with NIO would work so fucking weird
like 8 processor cores
MULTICORE BOIS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>java NIO (new input output) is the newer version of java io (wow shocking)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ASTONISHING<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the designers of java realized that java's io was drastically slower than other languages (C#, C++ namely), so they overhauled it
so Scanner and BufferedReader are actually some of the oldest IO frameworks you could use<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait no I was wrong
NIO stands for non-blocking io
not "new" io
lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats like the same thing
close enough
ACCORDING to some quick skims
it doesn't wait for blocks to read/write
it can just be like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait I was wrong twice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>read, put, done<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay hold on
scratch everything
restart<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright gonna restart my comp
brb<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Java NIO is Java's non-blocking io framework
it was originally designed alongside java's regular IO framework for the purpose of heavy duty data processing
it was remade in Java 7, technically a Java NIO 2.0 if you will
basically, if you wanna do actual file IO that isn't for babies, NIO would be your trick<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so
better file.io<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>actual file io
what you did before is baby mode
you think data centers use Scanner in their machines?
nah son<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah
of course<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we real file io hours<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright
time to get serious
here we come
where my jojo music at<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the downside of java nio is that it's a lot harder
like
a lot lot harder
it's like some second year object oriented programming kinds of hard
but you're in your second year
so go figure it out dumbass<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ive got this
and multicore
im no amateur
I ALREADY
HAVE
THAT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>here's the tutorial I used<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>OPEN<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look at this proactiveness<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're on the right track<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>first
multithread
THEN
nio
THEN
sort
i plan to use Arrays.sort
?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pop fucking quiz
what algorithm does Arrays.sort use<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh
isnt that the weird
find the pivot
i just looked it up like 5 minutes ago
isnt it just quicksort<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>`Implementation note: This implementation is a stable, adaptive, iterative mergesort that requires far fewer than n lg(n) comparisons when the input array is partially sorted, while offering the performance of a traditional mergesort when the input array is randomly ordered. If the input array is nearly sorted, the implementation requires approximately n comparisons. Temporary storage requirements vary from a small constant for nearly sorted input arrays to n/2 object references for randomly ordered input arrays.`
nevermind this isn't important<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this is exactly what i thought it would be<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>perfect
0 core processor
1 logical core
it's actually just a motherboard with transistors in it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>beep boop
not even
its just either on or off
its a fucking light switch<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>netbeans
youze netbeans<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck netbeans
jono is intellij certified now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you ever just wanna generate all your getters and setters automatically?
intellij does it with a single click
you wanna implement all required methods in an interface?
does that too
your code contain repetition?
intellij tells you it sucks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i used botg
both<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>netbeans is like an axe
intellij is like a laser chainsaw
with an auto reticle<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cs is hard
parker goes sooooo fast<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the trick to getting a good grade in cs is sitting next to someone who already knows the stuff<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cs was easy peazy
and i had 0 experience<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>maybe im just braindead lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nah im just galaxy brain<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fran had the advantage of being surrounded by intended cse majors the entire time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>to answer nearly any conceivable question<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i'll install remote desktop access so you can do my test for me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sssssSSSHHHHHHhhhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in cs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>two hundred and I'll do it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i can get bono to do it for free<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>charles had some struggles setting up remote desktop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then I'll grade your test as a TA
and proxy test jono against my gradescale

<|start-block|><@!213155390605492224> also the reason cs feels really hard
is because you don't know the norms yet
you don't know how things work and that's how its supposed to be
your entire first semester is "what the fuck is going on"
your IA forces you to adapt or die basically (or cheat, that's technically adapting)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh oh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but you have lots of people who know what they're doing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>So I'll get Alan to write my IA, got it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like literally anyone in disord can answer
IA is not actually hard
its the idea of figuring out whats going on
teaches you how IAs actually work
er
programs
and apps
and java
also writeup is BULLSHIT<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>the best part

<|start-block|>no taste
everyone who disagrees has no taste
everyone who does agree is cultured<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>It's just not special<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>A lot of it, to me at least, is quite repetitive which takes the magic away from the song
That's why short bumps from artists like tomppabeats are so good
Compared to the same beat over and over again for 3 minutes with little to no variation<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nope
no taste<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uncultured<|end-block|>

Melee is a real mans game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>melee isn't a smash game
get your facts straight<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I think there is an emerald City tournament thingie
I was watching a twitch stream and it had emerald City logo on it
Melee isn't a smash game
Because smash is for little girls
Melee is for real ones<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>real little girls?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Yes
We r all little girls at heart<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why do I hear knocking on my door<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>smash isnt a fighting game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Ur gonna die<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it isnt<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Indeed it isnt<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's just a party game played very competetively

<|start-block|>i havent heard about random crits since tf2
what in the fuck
1/8 is too high<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>tf2 died when they added that stupid fucking mm overhaul
They RUINED IT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>they added mm like 6 years toolate
too late*

<|start-block|>???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
like
what happened in this one year
serious question<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>WHAT THE FUCK
I HAD A 3.88<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i've been working on this physics lab for hOURS
AND IM STILL NOT DON
EEE<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i've not been working on thus physics lab for HOURS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>shut up WAR<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and i stullhavent started<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>art of WAR

<|start-block|><@189852772475207680> looking at the numbers I def got in on my essay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>looking at the numbers unless i write a nobel prize winner essay
im not getting in
its just numbers
seriously
3.88 range
1400 range
the only thing that puts me in there is my SAT
i hate school
why didnt i have a bigger brain before
why only junior year<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>u  got in-state going for u tho
and even if u dont get in initially
u can still transfer
i think u can have  like a 3.5 or something and transfer into uw after going to bc for a year or two
something like that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ESSAY
MAKE
YOUR ESSAY
GOLD
you think I got into engineering on stats alone?
BITCH NO
ESSAY<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> fool
i have learned the powers of multithreading
you cannot hope to stop me now
also where my daily hints at<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I have networks of virtual machines<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but do they have....
LOTS OF THREADS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Thousands<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>now im gunning for the sorting challenge
my plan of approach so far<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Has it actually started?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kind of
ive experimented with NIO
but i need to figure out a fast sorting algorithm to account for duplicates<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how many days are left in the competition<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>havent started
so what im going to do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mmmmmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is i have an array of 10 million numbers
i then send the first 1.25 million
to my first thread
sort it there<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you have NIO and you have multithreading<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then every thread sorts their section
yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're missing the final piece then<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>basically every thread is designated 1/8th<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the actual sorting algorithm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Arrays.sort<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're doing a merge sort there<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>change my mind
exactly
but its taking advantage of multithreading
as much as possible
because its all concurrent and objects when changed will change the location called from
its essentially gonna have 8 things merge sorting the same array
then to write
*yeah this ones hard*
im gonna try just blind writing it
but i doubt that will work
because compooters too fast
but thats my plan of approach i think<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im sleepy me go sleep<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no wait
your hint<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah i need that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm still thinking
merge sort isn't the fastest algorithm you can use<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I said my sorting algorithm used an integer array, right?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this might be a huge hint
but it has been a lot of daily hints missed
lemme double check real quick<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay I cant find the file but w/e
I used one integer array
one
integer
array<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but thats what i was gonna DOOOOOOOO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do you want the second part of the hint
if so, this'll be the last hint I give you until the day before the competition ends<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmmk
ill wait<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay
then a smaller hint to go with the half hint
uhhhhhhhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>java nio weird<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>MappedByteBuffer
that's it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>IM ALREADY USING THAT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck
uhhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Hi alan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhhhhhhh
okay
multithreading wasn't used for the actual sorting
multithreading was only used to read and write the numbers
that's the hint<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wait did you use multithreading<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
but if I did
my sorting algorithm wouldn't have benefitted from multithreading<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so remember
when there's less than 24 hours left in the competiton
I'll give you the name of the sorting algorithm I used
you'll know you found it if it sorts everything in 0.02 seconds<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>holy frick

I have no response<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gamecube is for man babies
is what he's saying
i think<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my pro controller remains loyal to the cause<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what do i write about for my short response
someone end me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ur mom<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh I did that for my main prompt<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jono have you not even startee<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ive done the main essay
its just the short response
ive been constantly thinking about it
but i can't get anywhere really
i could talk about my diverse club background
and how im a part of many clubs
which solve problems people face in our community and outside of our community
inside being green team, SOS, key club
outside being key club, geopolitics, and ESPORTS
jk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ESPORTS
alan wrote about esports<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats cuz he founded it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for his short reponse<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>am i supposed to say<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah ik<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>esports died as soon as i became president<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o h o k<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gonna leave that there
read
revise
do whatever
please hlep me im dead<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how many people have looked at it since I looked<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pepee<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
read the short response<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>read it
I think you're still writing this one with the main response as a frame
stop that
this one is 300 words of telling UW why you're gonna be a good addition to their community
so you wanna give an example of the impacts you've had on your community and show how that'd be beneficial to them<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the approach you're taking would be fine in a 500 word essay but for this one just give UW what they want
the prompt is really asking
"Why should we let you into our community?"
or
"What benefits would we see if we let you in here?"
or
"Tell us why you'll be a functioning member of campus society."

<|start-block|>good shit lmao
no but for a 300 word essay I think you hit the mark
you give UW a good reason why they should let you in
that's what a college essay really is about at the end of the day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you used the prompt as a vehicle for that message, which is all that really matters for a 300 word piece<|end-block|>

we started today
question
did you use mappedbytebuffer
or bytebuffer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mapped
that was already a hint
what's your current time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my current time is figuring out how nio works
this shit MEGAAAAAAAAAAA GAY<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my main issue right now is converting the buffer itself into integers for the array
because i know how to make a charbuffer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's not thaaaaaat hard
just do MATH<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have the charbuffer all handy dandy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THEN DO MATH<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the ways to cast the chars into integers are so slow<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>DO
MATH<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i know you can do like
or something<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>DO
MATH
MULTIPLY<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what in the fuck does that mean<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that's your hint<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thank god<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>math<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i could have never imagined<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there's an entire section in my nio stuff that converts numbers
do
the
math
(n - 48) * 10^d
d being the power of 10
needed to get that digit to the right place
that's your hint
for today<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>are you telling me
you made your own parser
you take the digit
change it from its character value
and move it a certain amount of spaces
and add it all up
to get a single number<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>here's the actual line
your first glimpse at my actual source code<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what in the<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>powerOfTen returns a power of 10 (1, 10, 100, 1000 etc.) given a place
now
go do that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah im going to sleep
good night<|end-block|>

nov 1<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wow 1 week left<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uh
MappedByteBuffer
lol
uh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the sorting method I used only works with integers
specifically
only integers<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>counting
soooort<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>correcto<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i looked up the big O cheat sheet
the issue is
reading the bytebuffer
i have no idea how it works still to this day<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@189852772475207680>
can you drive yet<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Why bother? It's not like you need a student ID to go to campus or enter the lecture halls. Just show up to class unenrolled and study. You won't have any kind of college transcript or degree but it's the knowledge that matters, right?
That way it's free, too<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>A Matthew (or Matt/Mat/[Matty]/[Mattie]) will make the best boyfriend/[guyfriend] ever. With their big brown eyes, and heart-melting smile it's hard not to fall for them. They are different, in a beautiful way. Possesses a very funny, odd sense of humor. They are there when you need them, and they value their friendships. They like to look good, and dress well. Handsome, and charming. They've had a [hard life], but never gets kicked down and stays down. They change for the better, and stronger than ever. Very successful at life, make great Dads. Known to be players but when they meet that special girl, their sold. Matthew's come off as tough and solid, but deep down, their [soft side] comes out and you see the sweet gentleman in them. They're not popular, but not a loner either. Friends love them, and guys want to be him. They have a really laid back attitude about themselves, but at the same time they can be the life of the party. Even though they can be a jerk at times, they mean well and are really the nicest guys ever. If you have a Matthew, don't let him go. None other compares."

<|start-block|>jesus christ<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>wtf is this<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>we're testing <@!189852772475207680>'s urban dictionary code
with <@!556987075308814346><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i obliterate my opponents<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Holy shit rin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's okay it's in quotes
that what we learned in middle school<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LOL<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LMFAO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rin has spoken<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>boop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this is moderately fucked
maybe the fourth worst thing I've ever added to Starbot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I dont think I smell good. Or can rope. Tf is roping<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its when you put a rope around someones penis and pull them in<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Ah yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im scared
alan what is this monstrosity jono created<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jono<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>jono<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the "idiot" response is hard-coded by bono
the "nothing came up" is by me
so he's the one calling you an idiot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>facts<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!189852772475207680>
doesn't work with queries with spaces<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i just cheesed it with string
the code is not good atall
i literally used scanner<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Show could it not work with spaces? Is it not taking the whole message after "define" as a string?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it could work
but the way i do it
is i take the url
and just like
add a string onto a string
fixable
BUT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Does it go to ud.com/<string>?
So spaces don't work?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>something like that
you could add spaces
by simply doing
if term.contains(space) or some shit
then you find the spaces in some sort of char array
???
not that
find the spaces
replace with
whatever the fuck they want
yeah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I tried<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Ahhh big smart<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok alan
youre into that stuff?
damn.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Umm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>damn ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>What<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>URLs use + as fill ins for spaces<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Not for rsl apparently
Hmm
I guess the ud for rsl is just weird<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i do hate it but keep playing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>restarting
to fix the spaces issue<|end-block|>

<|start-block|><@!189852772475207680> got a coding question for you
PlaylistGenerator-stub.java<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>one current issue with Groupify is that it's calling the Spotify API too many times (upwards of hundreds of times per session), resulting in a TooManyRequests exception
this method is one of the culprits
can you explain why?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you said you wanted to do a version of Groupify didn't you
if you're gonna do it then this is something you'll come across<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thas a lot of for loops<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the specific API call being called a lot is #getArtist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gonna have to guess its within your else statement
i would ASSUME
most songs have one artist<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>correct
and what happens if we have hundreds of songs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you die<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>kinda yeha
the getArtist request is called once per song
what I should've done instead is create a list of artist ids to look up
then used #getSeveralArtists instead to save on API bandwidth<|end-block|>

<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> how to spotify auth<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rest api callback<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for now set the callback to local host 8080 and copy paste the code by hand<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so like
i have my redirecturi set to localhost
but it keeps giving me an error when i try to authenticate
like code must be supplied<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>look at the url after you authenticate<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you should get a authentication uri from the Spotify object, launch it in a browser, then copy paste the code found in the url<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok ill try<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do
ok ill do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>holy shit alan ur a genius
or more specifically
this guy is also a genius<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> im still on the code must be supplied tho
but i have achieved the access token and refresh token<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```
1. init spotify object using client secret and key
2. get authentication uri from spotify object and launch in browser
3. log in to Spotify and copy paste the ?code=XXXXXX... code into your program
4. authenticate the Spotify object using the auth code
5. do client-specific operations
```
<@!189852772475207680> these steps<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well im stuck on authentication
i have the accesstoken = xxxxx
and etc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but when i try to authenticate the spotify object
it gives me an error
like in the examples you know how theres a try catch loop
with authcodereceiver and authcodecredentials
it says code must be supplied but im followin the example on thelinmichael's github<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay so the vocab is getting watered down
there's three-ish things you need to get a fully functioning Spotify API<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>1. Client ID
2. Client Secret
3. Authentication Code (from a specific user)
the auth code comes into the picture once you logged into Spotify
unless you want to learn how to create a web service callback
what you basically have to do is
1. wait until the user has logged in
2. ask them to copy-paste the auth code in with a Scanner
3. authenticate<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>now the auth code can be found in the url right
like once they login<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the page that opens
well i did that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>should be a blank page
url should have `code?=asiotszhetuizshetpusp98` in it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o ok
ill try it later<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you want it to be done automatically you'll have to learn Spring and REST APIs
like, building them yourself<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>brug<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how would i go about building one of these myself<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>```java
// receives a Spotify Authentication Callback
    @RequestMapping(value = "api/callback")
    public String callback(
            @RequestParam(value = "code", defaultValue = "") String code,
            @RequestParam(value = "state", defaultValue = "") String state) {
        // if the code or state returned nothing, return an error message
        if (code.isEmpty()) {
            return "error retrieving code";
        }
        else if (state.isEmpty()) {
            return "error retrieving state";
        }

        // find the party id and execute the corresponding listener
        String partyId = state.split(":")[0];
        for (AuthenticationListener listener : GroupifyService.AUTHENTICATION_LISTENERS) {
            // if the ids match
            if (listener.partyId().equals(partyId)) {
                // execute that listener
                listener.onAuthenticationSuccess(code, state);
                // return happy message
                return "thanks. you can close this now.";
            }
        }

        // if no party with the id was found return error
        return "error retrieving party with id " + partyId;
    }
```
this method specifically<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's actually not terrible if you ignore the annotations
`public String callback(String code, String state)`<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ib better give me a 7 for this IA
my god<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then I decided to send the code into an authentication listener system
you know how in some apis you can do `new CallbackListener()` or whatever
that's what I did
I made my own<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes
o ok<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sent it through that and my program on the other side receives it
then I go and auth<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you know
if I publish a Spotify API Callback library on the internet
you could technically use my code as a "public library"
sus? yes.
technically not against the rules?
also yes.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ur against the rules<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>a what now
speak in retard please<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>**which library are you using for the spotify api**<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright this is gonna need to be more in-depth

<|start-block|>```java
  private static final AuthorizationCodeUriRequest authorizationCodeUriRequest = spotifyApi.authorizationCodeUri()
//          .state("x4xkmn9pu3j6ukrs8n")

<|start-block|><@!478706068223164416> do you happen to know how to create any sort of webpage where i can grab the code from the url and display it in a friendly way that isn't locally hosted<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you want to trust a free internet service that promises to handle your auth tokens for you with absolute care and no malicious intent?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the short answer is "do it yourself"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well no i mean like
the issue im stuck on right now
is that i need a redirect uri for my spotify app, which needs to basically say to the user "copy this shit down and give it back to the app"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but right now it only works when i locally host the service, and it doesn't work when i deploy it on azure because its specifically configed to work on localhost
or something
im not actually sure myself because azure isn't giving me any sort of error returns<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>uhhh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're gonna need to get the ip of your Azure service
port forwarding and stuff<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok
will look<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok better question
how did you do that thing where it said "you can close this now"
because the issue is the only person who would ever be able to open my redirect page is me, and nobody else
but i remember i was able to open your redirect<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I was hosting the entire thing on my computer
The callback was actually set to my ip address<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>The message is the response my computer gives to you once it receives your code<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so how did you get the code in the first place
if the message is the response<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>by writing my own callback handler
aka
writing my own REST API<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>right
i remember you told me this in the car
any guides on how to do that
that you remember using?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>System.out.println("Dab");<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this teaches you how to create a rest api in general<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you can read it all or just pay attention to the "Create a Resource Controller" section
```java
package com.example.restservice;

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class GreetingController {

    private static final String template = "Hello, %s!";
    private final AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong();

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public Greeting greeting(@RequestParam(value = "name", defaultValue = "World") String name) {
        return new Greeting(counter.incrementAndGet(), String.format(template, name));
    }
}
```
the part where they do this
some black magic happens<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the important part is that the method `greeting()` will receive HTML requests at `http://someip/greeting`
expecting the parameter `name`
similar to how Spotify will call your callback at `http://someip/callback` with a parameter `token`<|end-block|>

I'm so far behind
I took like a two week break<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bruh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I need to make my house payments
how to get money fast

<|start-block|>turnips
turnipsturnipsturnips
I invest 1 million weekly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bruh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>then ask your friends for their prices
I sold my last week's off at 162 over at Alexis' island<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>isn't 162 low
bc I see ppl rocking like 500+ bell prices<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah it was lower than I wanted
but it was Saturday and I didn't get any good prices that entire week
I had a 500 once and made like 800k off it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is a decent price for turnips to buy <100
per each<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it ranges from 90 to 110
so anything under 100 is fine
but it really doesn't matter in the big picture

also reminders are canceled if Starbot shuts down unexpectedly so don't actually rely on him for important stuff<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>game during lecture
dumy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>omg trueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
i could be playing more oriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dark souls pvp actually so fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you just figured this out?
its fun until it isnt really
which game
1 2 or 3<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>3
i made a low level gank stomping build<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah that one has longevity
2 has all the variety
1 has all the backstabs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>POWERSTANCE
the parry sound actually makes me a bit hard every time i hear it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ohh yeah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and then the sweet sound of a hornet ring riposte completes it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wish plays.tv sitll worked i had some fun tiems in that game<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the onloy bad part is that im trying to beat the game at sl20 adn +2
so every boss after catacombs has midir level health<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oof<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so when i die to a boss a ton i just go stomp some ganks to lower salt<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i had to do ng+4 midir at sl 145 with +3 phantom difficulty alone with only blue estus
cleric build baby
it took 15 minutes
but i did it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>noice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>all my firends died<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>atleast it wasnt a pyromancy build<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!189852772475207680> <@!145664386021720064> im looking at you
<@!478706068223164416> too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ofc is bono<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>in my fucking defense
I tried my best<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its on my plays.tv, the whole fight, but theres a slight problem where the playstv website stopped working <:dude:703877417311404042><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>honestly summoning more than 1 phantom for midir is not worht it
because health pool tooo big<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>YEAH FRAN<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i didnt upload that midir fight to my yt<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HEAR THAT?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>big sad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HEALTH POOL TOO BIG<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HEALTH POOL TOO BIG
YOU GUYS DIED IN LIKE 30 SECONDS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmoa just use pestilant mercury
percentage health decrease<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>IM THE ONLY ONE THAT DEALT WITH THE HEALTH POOL PROBLEM
you think a cleric build can run pestilent mercury<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>did you use lightning?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i had lightning arrows (giga carried btw), the gigantic aoe heal, the ranged heal projectile, and something else<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i imaging a lightning or blessed dragonslayer's axe would do work<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and my lightning infused mace<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and again, no blue estus
er, no orange estus
15 blue swigs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sunlight spear wouldve been epic<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>epic
but expensive<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because just gwyn vs archdragon
but 15 blue chugs<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but i need that for healing too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh rigjt<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>teammates and myself<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao just dont get hit ez<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the teammates side of thing wasnt super big
except when we were doing it in their worlds
the amount of times i tried to heal them and they ran away from me
big sad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>classic<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>BIG SCARY DRAGON APPROACHING HEALY CIRCLE
ABORT MISSION<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i made this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIbw-pCLypE
why did i made this
a spotify ad lined up jut too perfectly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip the fight club<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>at that point i was full-blown invader<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>best part about low level invasions are that everyone dies slower<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fight clubs could kick it to the curv<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you can practice parrying
and i got good at prediction parrying
and have become the bane of overaggresive phantoms<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im not sure why they went back on that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gotta admit
my fashion
on point<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gundyr's helm is very underrated for fashion souls<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gundyr's helm <:dude:703877417311404042><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not what you are using
fire witch set is pretty good too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this helmet is the big sexy
fire witch is good<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh wait nvm thats boreal knight helm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the cathedral knight ugs is also hella good
it has light to heavy true combo
and also looks amazing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i used that one for a while
when i was running 40str 40fth
and 30vgr
lol
i would lightning buff my *ultra greatsword*
i wasnt very bright<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i used darkmoon blade on fume for a bit
double tap sword<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ohehehe
i used
astora straight sword
and darkmoon blade
for a WHILE
im not proud<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ive never actually used a straight sword in pvp
most of my experiences were with ultras
where i just baited for a trade
and immediately made them regret<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i remember
i remember
that fucking midir fight
lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i remember when jono orignally played dark souls with me
and i remember he chose to be a purple phantom
then i didnt know the difference
but now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>who here committed UW
I want a show of hands<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>troy did today
jono is uw bothell i think<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>I won
I thought he was gonna quit out
But in the end I just roll caught him to death
No chance to estus<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>What weapon<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@185146828050792449> greatsword or halberd<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>black knight great axe<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i was using the claymore then switched to dragonslayer axe
they played pretty passively
whevern someone did play aggresively i just parried then deleted<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i didnt have a straight sword on the build so it kinda suckedd for a bit<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>correct<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have to determine the current through each resistor
and the charge on the capacitors
fkn killlllll me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for an emf of 67
if you wanna help me feel free ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fisikis<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fisikys<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nah fuck dat i h8 electro and mag<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the capacitors scare me
im not sure how to handle them<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hold up do the capacitors just have no effect on the system?
once they're fully charged<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>YOOO
THE CAPACITORS MAKE THAT BRANCH HAVE NO CURRENT
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THIS MAKES IT A SINGLE LOOP SIRCUIT
BRO WTF<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THIS PROBLEM IS STILL AIDS<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just used a straight sword for the first time
dam that shit so easy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eezee munnee
are you using the wex dust mod<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nah
just vanilla<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>do you know what the wex dust mod does?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>is htat the one where you can invade from firelink?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye
seems lit
you can invade from anywhere<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that sounds nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its just a red eye orb that scans the whole game instead of just your area
ban-safe apparently<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im taking a break from my low level characer because im stuck on pontiff
so i making a sl 50 that is gonna be super versitile<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pontiff ezpz
just hit him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pontiff when you do double digit damage is not
also i get 2-3 shot because sl20<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>are we talking like level 10 low level?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>20<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im not that good at parrying him tho<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you need cleric boi to give you a hand?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nah i got it
ive already sauced dancer and champ gundy
so i know i can do it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>n i c e<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gundyr was 11 consecutive parries
because i was a 1 shot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i always did sl120-145
except for one sl70 soul of cinder cosplay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>meta level is too cancer for invasions
low level is fun to learn stuff
mid level is just fun
and like sl 80-90 is fun too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i jus always found it too hard to get everything i wanted in a build at low levels
like my anti-pope build
using the crystal chime
and a dark weapon wit ha chaos dagger on the side for parries<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>low level builds are basically just raw builds
but for sl50 you can get a good faith nuker build
liek phantom 1 shots with sunlight spear<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>or you can go like 40 str and no other stats like the build i wanted to do but i think i deleted<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>warren
dont we have graphic design homework due todya<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes from last week
if you didnt do it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>okay

<|start-block|>depends on what drawing you choose

in my server<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey <@!185146828050792449> are you doing dark souls invasions on PC or console?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>any issues with hackers?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not really
but thats because most are mid to low level
i dont go above sl100<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmm<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>most hackers and cancer ganks are at meta at liek 120-140<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the hackers im owrried about are the get-you-banned type
which i haven't had before (obviously)
but ive heard off hand that its bad these days<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>basically just dont pick up items<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fair<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and if somethings looking fishy just run away and black crystal<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>aight tenks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>np<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>SL1 pontiff is f u c k i n g h a r d<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but atleast you are doing triple digit damage
i made my character that im gonna keep at around sl50 "CockBallTorture"
invasions are gonna be great<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Yeah the damage is fine in sl1
The problem is no health and no stam<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>LLOYD SHIELD RING<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I have it yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and now you can not get 1 shot
also prisoner's chain
whenver i do low sl runs i ALWAYS get that before ayss watchers<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I think my buffered rolls have something else to say about being "one shot"
It's really 2
But very fucking annoying<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for me pontiff low sl is either become dodge god or parry god
champ gundy is always parry god<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also have you seen chasethebro recent vids?
he got the fuckin lothric knight greatsword swap on parry
its insane<|end-block|>

<|start-block|><@!145664386021720064> imagine Valve announcing a TF3<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>immagine<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>All this kid does is just hold a gay ass off angle with his deag and one clicks people in the side of the head CT side. Fucking terrbile player tbh.....1.4 sensitivity 400dpi using trashcan. Anyone who uses a low sens does not have the dexterity to properly play FPS games on PC.

All the shitty baiters use a low sens to click people on the back of the head, or they are equally worthless and use the telescope gun and one click people in the body.

I bet this kid doesn't even play FFA Dm's cuz he'd throw his arm out of his socket checking corners. When was the last time you've seen Niko popflash through a smoke, and flick too two people to open up a site??? All this dude does is hold shift and prefire common angles. like wow dude, ur fucking nuts. you can have parkinsons disease and play on 1.4 sens if ur just baiting and clicking heads on common angles.

this is why forest and get right are sick players. they play on higher senitivities, and can do more than bait and off angle one click.

pce<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im a 400dpi trashcan<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Is that through steam?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah
go to properties
then local files
then verify game integrity
it takes a bit but it usually solves everything for me<|end-block|>

<|start-block|><@!185146828050792449> flamberge or black blade for friede<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nvm black blade did it 1st try
thought i'd take myu chances till you answered
didnt expect it to go so smooth<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>noice
i never used any katanas
so i dont know
but flamberge imo is better for pvp unless you like bleed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i was just asking for friede<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>flamberge weapon art r2 does weirdly high damage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so far im finding the fire dagger to not be very effective
but thats against pve
i havent used it in pvp yet<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i just only use it in pvp
if you areusing a dex build honestly sharp would prob work better<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the reason why alot of builds use fire is because dagger no scale with strength<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah i c
gotta farm another sharp gem then kek<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>damn this dex build is fun
flamberge and black blade are so fun
and carthus cgs
essentially the bleed weapons are fun
ive procced it twice
once from just swinging on a guy for a while
once on a backstab
sadly that backstab didnt kill the guy
800+ damage on a flamberge backstab tho
good shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>have you tried onikiri and udabachi
the dual blades are always fun<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>nah that was lex<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>noooo
i would never submit such a thing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>But why frame me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gotta ask bon that<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><:thonk:406977555116064768><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah ok buddy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bouta get cinders mod
hopefully i dont install it wrong and get softbanned <:oroLUL:554196357452267540><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>a google search tells me that <@!470822754262712329> might be one of the only natural language discord bots in the world
huge asterisk on "natural" though
well it's machine learning so eh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> how's it feel being the chosen one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if so I might try and push a Global Language Model update sooner than later
basically Starbot would take messages from all servers and merge them into one model<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it would probably improve his communication effectiveness a few fold
because it increases his dataset 4-5 times over<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>That might just be terrifying
He would be closer to sentient
As if he wasn't already close enough<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@470822754262712329> you scare me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I think an update of that scale would actually require planning though
plus there's a few issues regarding privacy and consent<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Why so
Hasn't he already taken each server's data individually?
What's the problem with all of them then<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>individually yes
but a global model would introduce the possibility of cross-server information leaking<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Oh right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>like imagine if the only sentence in another server is "bono is a cunt"
bono is a cunt would be able to be sent in literally any server Starbot is in whether bono is there or not<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Right<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if you want an extreme example of the possible consequences, remember that one twitter bot Microsoft created<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>No
Oh yes
That rings some bells<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it's an interesting and important case study of language modeling and its possible effects<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if he can learn anything, he can say anything
and sometimes anything isn't acceptable<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>Demon souls remake when?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>never<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dark souls remastered remaster when?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>DEMOIN'S SOULS REMASTER IS REAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLL
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>HOW DID YOU KNOW WARREN
INSIDER INFO<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it better be remake
i hope it comes to steam too
because no ps5<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>me too<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hoyl shit it looks so nice
da graphics<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>teh dragon god in the remake looks so nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also bloodborn remaster will be all worth it if it comes to pc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there was nothing about bb remaster<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bb doesnt need remaster<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think there are rumors<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>just need pot
port*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it looks really good on ps4<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>there are rumors about bloodborne stuff
but the sony game show thing jsut ended
and there was no bloodborne<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also it seems  that fromsoft is not working on demons souls
so hope elden ring comes out without getting delayed<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ye bluepoint is doing the remake
in all fairness theres a very small chance its coming to pc, unfortunately<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>@here vote for new nickname length<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>see but 3 is objectively the best number
ask the ancient greeks<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes but our names are four letters long<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><:thonk:702395981903429732> i dont see the relevance<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>four is the number of death<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>that is true<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my name is five letters long
choosing four is discrimination<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I have names of 3, 4, and 5 length
I am the neutral<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>out of fairness to everyone i think 2 is ideal since very few people have 2 letter names
you can just use your initials<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmmm that does make sense<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I have three initials though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well screw you
you get to choose which one you like the least then<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>(i'm just trolling, actually i don't care how long our names are lmao)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you see the problem came up that we have 3 alexes in this server
alex alex and alexis
we're running out of feasible permutations of the name alex<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>well its alex alejandro and alexis
so<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you get to excise any four letters from your name
lots of possible combinations<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how about
Troy Lu
Alan Wen
Etc

<|start-block|>Glorious<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just invaded a hacker
i dunked his phantom off a cliff
and suddenly he had no hitbox<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont think thats hacking
thats just really bad desync
ive seen it a lot
er, a decent amount<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>maybe
i just black crystalled because he wasnt attacking back
i think i invaded a cinders mod guy tho
because invisible sword<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah that sounds even more like desync
cause yo them you were probably somehwere else entirely
or gliding
cinders mod is lit
i had the pleasure of encountering a pursuer
i.e. an npc in pursuer armor
it was hilarious
especially since ive been playing ds2 a lot as wel<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>noice
his invisible sword didnt matter because greathammer poise<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what i find funny about running into cinders players
is that they choose to risk getting softbanned
cause cinders defaults the game to offline<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah
i was thinking his prob gonna get banned if he keeps playing online
now i have my friede smasher
so when i do ashes im not gonna struggle<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for  a seci thought you were naming some weapon from cinders mod
cause i wouldnt even be surprised
THEY ADDED IN THE DRAGON BONE SMASHER FROM DeS
I WANT IT
BUT IM DOING A FATIH BUILD<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>noice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>landing a fully charged r2 with an ultra is really something special<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hey
u missed
u suck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>finally way of white corona that doesnt suck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>alright
since I just remembered
commencement for the class of 2020 is now live<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yay!!!
I'm purple now ??<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hmm
now that basically everyone's a university student it kinda makes stuff useless<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>eh
nobody cares anyway lol<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no more purple :(<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why'd you vote for fuck troy, troy?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because I want to make myself suffer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mooooooooom troy's being horny on main again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>quick
get the cage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not the cage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes the cage
you must be contained until further notice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gub<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah okay I guess<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>¿<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Dafuq is going on<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!556987075308814346>
what else does bot do<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>used to do a lot more<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>as they used to say in the home country
how embarrassing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rin is currently running off the server equivalent of a nintendo ds<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>reminds me of something they used to say back in the home country
how embarrassing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm pretty sure if you ping her enough times you can crash her<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wont bully bot<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you just wait till <@!470822754262712329> himself returns from the dead<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>where is he<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hell<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>o
f<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>whats !someone
oh
oops<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sup bitches<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>aww
<@!556987075308814346> you miss your brother?
oh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how embarrassing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why are there emoticons now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>literally nobody asked<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dumb fuck I just asked<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ok but did I ask???<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm taking away your server owner roles<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but <@!556987075308814346> is the owner<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>crinj
I go play chess bye<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>CHESS
okay but who asked???
? ? ?
still can't find them???<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>partizan is kinda insane
it has like 4 different true combos
and a pseudocombo that can 1 combo full health hosts<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think i have *owned* the partizan on all of one character<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip
i used it a bit on my sl60 character for some invasions<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>isnt the ringed knight spear the same thing but longer though
save for the weapon art<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>partizan moveset is insane
heavy attack is a sweep that is a guaranteed roll catch on a panic roll
and heavy attacks combo into eachother<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah the ringed knight spear has the same heavies
idk if they combo into each other though<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you can combo 2 heavies and a rollcatch heavy into the entire weapon art<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>weapon art is unparriable so thats one thing over the ringed knight spear<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wanna invade chase nap and lance but i have cinders mod <:oroThump:554196350850433024><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip
i guess its hard to disable because some character items will break maybe<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also i found out you can farm for a claymore
kinda crazy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yessir<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also the flamberge does so much damage on weapon art r2 because it has same motion value as a stomp
instead of the normal greatsword stance r2<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mhm
weird that its called motion value
but hey<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>gimme dat damage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for my sl60 faith variation should i have 40 faith but have enough strength and dex to open up weapon variety or stick with 45 faith and focus on sunlight spear nuking<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>leveling in cinders mod is super cheap
after 9 hours im sl 200+<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice
thats the main reason why ive never gone past sl 120
its like almost 100k for 1 level<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>at sl 210
my next level up costs
8469 souls<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>BRUh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ive got 99 faith
and 59 attunement<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>one endgame boss with a symbol of avarice swap and your at like 2020<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>idk what to do with my levels<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>220
strength?
morne's great hammer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for my weapon im using the censuring fists
lightning infused
cause they make your hands glow with lightning<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but otherwise look like bare fists<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>u wot m8<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>THERES 3 SANDWORMS IN THE LAKE
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>solaire^3<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!213155390605492224> shut up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Hi alan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hi alan<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>shut<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>u shut<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have reached my final form<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i killed an overleveled phantom in a fight club and got 34k souls
wtf<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ive gotten 300k from an overleveled summon in an invasion
that'd be sl 670ish iirc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and im happy to report that with point-blank sunlight spear spam i killed oceiros in cinders mod without him activating phase 2
same for champ gundy
i staggered him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>niceeee<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and then staggered him again before he recovered<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice
lmao a blue just got summoned and he got bodyblocked by phatoms so a red could kill him<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><:oroClap:554196349164191760><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuckin blues
just came in r1<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its terrifying when you get a competent blue summon<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>too bad thats rare<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah..<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>9/10 times its usualy some estus delivery
which is nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>cinders mod is done~~<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice
rate the mod<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>quite good
magic/miracles are op as all hell
enemy damage was toned down pretty much across the board for some reason
some really nice qol features like being able to redo bosses to get all the transpositions<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nice nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>biggest issue is that all the quest lines get messed up cause you go through the areas in a totally different order
now i shall uninstall
so i can pvp once again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ahhh
damn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no siegward on yhorm fight <:oroThump:554196350850433024><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>;-;<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh shit
ive broken 1200 hours across all the dark souls games
1237<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dam<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>12.37% of the way to 10k hours
im 12.37% a dark souls professional ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you got a lot of work to do over summer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also a lot of other games to play
i gotta finish celeste
and i bought jedi fallen order a couple days ago
and i have new vegas to play
and witcher 3
ima be busy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>witcher 3 is fun
death march is only way to play<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oh yeah high difficulties are where i like it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its not very hard still<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>try playing a mage in skyrim on legendary<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but it forces you to use more of the combat system<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you'll hate yourself until you get 100 enchanting<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>skyrim combat is just potato<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it feels more impactful as a mage imo
or actually
play a melee character
on legendary
good luck surviving anything without the violens mod<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just feel like there is no variation<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>enemies will jsut walk up and animation kill you instantly<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and once you get good at enchanting
you have 1 billion damage weapons<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>skyrim is potato
oooooo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im honestly surprised i have less than 400 hours in skyrim
i still havent done the dragonborn dlc <:oroLUL:554196357452267540><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have less than 500 hours
currently at 499<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>pog
oh and i should finally actually play torchlight 2
i remember enjoying it
then i just stopped playing
and now torchlight 3 is on the way<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have way more hours than i expected in terraria
it just has so much REPLAYABILITY<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sub 200 hours in terraria gang represent<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>currently at 566
i was at around 500 before 1.4<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i had 1027 hours across all dark souls like a month ago
now im at 1237
210 hours in a monthish<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>damn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i remember putting like 1k hours in warframe across a little over a year
then burning out so hard i cant even remember my character<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>warfram <:oroLUL:554196357452267540>
i think i have 24 hours in warframe
and 3 episodes of a playthrough i did with kenneth in like 8th grade or something
lmao<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>making videos is fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its a good game just way to grindy
actually the grind aint to bad
its the catchup grind of you take a break that is really bad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>ah i was wrong<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>skyrim is too hard to make it work for me<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>21 horus in warframe<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i cant resist the temptations of mods
and then i install it correctly every time
but eventually the limitations of a 32 bit engine reach me
and i start CTD every 5 min<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>all mods i used were either audio fixes, visual fixes, or violens so i could decapitate people more and not get bullshit one shot on legendary<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>if skyrim SE gets on sale ill get it
yea i use a TON of graphics and script mods
the last time i modded it
i got 120 mods.<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think i had like 6 mods at my peak<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i got skyrim se for free because i had all the dlc<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im a hardcore modder ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and it looked shat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lol
i use graphic mods
and like<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>same<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>follower mods<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so SE looked ass<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i like having a small army with me
like a goon squad<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fus ro door best mod<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>SE has decent mods now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>never level lockpicking<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>FBI OPEN UP<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>did they bring skyui to se?
i last played skyrim on DECEMBER 31, 2017
damn<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yea
its been there for a LONG time<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bruh what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>holy shit i was so confused on that part
thank god theres a guide now<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i gotta play witcher 3 again
and make a cocaine fiend built
build<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the guids we deserve
idk who anna henrietta is
but this seems important<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>she is
but DONG is more<|end-block|>
<|start-block|><@!110137446053736448>
i
fucking
hate
you<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>what
why
im
what<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>this is fortunate timing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>why am i to blame
i still dont see why im at fault<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>REMINDED ME
OF THE DAMN GAME
SO NOW I REMEMBERED TO GET IT<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>all i have to say is i hope you enjoy it ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fuck you fran<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I mean sure I just did t think y'all swung that way<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bouta try making a build with cheat engine for the first time
wish me luck<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>so you dont have to clear the game?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>seem really convenient
get all da +2 and 3 rings
even the ng+3 rings<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>legit a 5 minute video
lit
i can spawn 5 copies of the cat ring
easy swaps<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>quakestone hammer aqured<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also demon's greataxe to swap to<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i feel like its ar will be kinda ass because scaling
isnt too good at low sl<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i feel like 400 ar is aight
although it is split<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>for a greataxe too
like i feel like you could get more in non split
with a different one<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah but then its not a real demon boy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>here lemme check<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>419 demon's +2
insufficient stats for regular greataxe
<:oroLUL:554196357452267540><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>heavy greataxe +2 at 32 str is 319 ar
so
its way less damage
er, ar
damage isp robably comparable<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>at sl 60 its def +3 atleast
i always 2 hand ultras because its too easy to parry otherwise<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oop
you're right
i was thinking tt/ts upgrade path<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>heavy greataxe +4 with adjusted stats is 381 ar
so 38 less
but not split<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>hold up sl60 is +6
wtf am i doing<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yee<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i can't find ODK's hammer on CE
bruh ?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>imo the only greataxes worth using are the dragonslayer for the weapon art nuke and the black knight for the moveset<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bro its not about the quality of the build
its for the cosplay
you think i play this game to win?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but other greataxes just boring vertical chop<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but they have even more boring weapon arts
save for DSGA<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just prefew greathammers
over greataxes<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>IWANNA USE ODK'S HAMMER
BUT CE DOESNT SEEM TO HAVE IT
BRUHHHHHHHHH<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>dragon king greataxe is on here
which is a ds1 weapon
do i risk spawning it in
to see if its a misnomer?
nah i think i speedrun to ODK
and transpose from his soul
cause i cant spawn boss souls ?
safely<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>prob safer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>mueheheheh<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dunked a dude with quakestone weapon art
so fuin<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>bootyful<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>blues are so funny
never have i seen more people try to parry greathammers<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also met an r1 warrior blue who thought he could out trade a great hammer with his 1 handed greatsword
didnt even get to land any hits<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oof
yeah blues can be real comical
but sometimes they are just the extra blade the blender needs to grind you up<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>thats why i love the quakestone
they get hhit by the first<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and so by the second<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and get decimated by the second<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i used the quakestone once on my strength build
i wanna use it more
but the WA is too slow for the damage it deals<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just use it to bait<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>800 damage at sl90 for a move that takes all my stam and more?
yikers<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>because you can delay the 2nd sqing
so they think its safe then boom
they get launched<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i guess
but the stam cost is just too high<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah
i have 30 stam and it uses my entire bar<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i think my sl90 is in the same boat<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip
i might experiment with a axe in the offhand with wooden mallet
because mallet is only 6 weight<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>handaxe
is so nice
once i did on a quality build
main hand handaxe
offhand dagger for the diferent moveset
granted i was a duelist then
but it was still fun<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just wish i didnt have to farm a shit ton of heavy gems<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you dont have to
er
wait
yeah you dont
CE baby<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>its real easy to get
save you a lot of heartache<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i like farming in games
and it helps i have the coiled sword fragment<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>> i just wish i didnt have to farm
> i like farming in games
<:thonk:702395981903429732><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have conflicted feeling
like its a mood
sometimes i just wanna farm and listen to music
also when the farm is hard the end product feels so nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>true
SPEEDRUN TIME BOYS
HOW FAST CAN I GET TO ODK<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>2<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i will start a timer
ill report back when im done<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>im almost done setting myself up for an ultimate boss rush
i got aldrich yhorm, dragonslayer armor, friede, and nameless ready to fight<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>also pickaxe and leoring is pretty good combo
because of that sweet sweet trade damage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>vordt died in 5 htis
holy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>21:26
odk is dead<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>first invasion as the demon build
a win the demon ruins
how perfect<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i wonder what the host thought when, in the demon ruins, they see "Invaded by dark spirit A Demon"<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i accidentally gave myself emotes as items ?
gotta go offline
install a mod to discard them
discard the emotes
then go back online
oof<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>problem solved
ban evaded (i hope)<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>never gets old seeing someone try to parry a 2 handed greathammer
only to lose all of their stamina and get hit again<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>one of my favorite things has quickly become getting kills with the ODK hammer weapon art
cause you HAVE  to either trap the min a corner of find a total dunce<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>how well does it work during blenders<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>havent tried
but its slow enough where you'd probbably die<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>does it not give very much damage resistance like stomp or perserverance?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and its effective range is bad enough to where you;d be lucky to do any amount of damage to mroe than one person<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah its perseverance but you still take damage
and my resistancei s prety damn low<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>oof<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i also keep desyncing
from like 50% of hosts
it sucks
hosts and phantoms*<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sad
i got the ultimate strat for greathammers on brainless ganks
i just run around and corral them into a big group
then trade and hit all 3 or 4 with the 2 hit combo
its so satisfying to do like 2k-3k damage total across all the phantoms<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>juicy<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i just had an invasion
where i could hit the host
but his phantom and i couldnt hit each other
so the phantom just followed the host around casting heal
oof<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao rip<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>some dum dum just tried to jump attack me while i did an r2 with lorian's greatsword
772 damage
at sl66
marvelous<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>one shot?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>nah hel ived cause he was the host<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>he ended up dying to a parry<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>rip
whenever i see a parry god
i whip out an ultra
no getting parried today<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i dont usually have to do that
cause im using ultra anyway <:oroLUL:554196357452267540><|end-block|>
<|start-block|>sometimes i use claymore
and when i get a runner i use winged knight twinaxes
the twinaxes with a bundle do ridiculous damage
basically sellsword twinblades for strength<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>filthy metamancer
lorian's gs
demon's ga
odk hammer
gargoyle flame spear
and ringed knight ss for annoying people<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i gotta clear grand archives for hunters ring
so i can finally use black knight weapons
that 18 dex requirement is painful<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>damn today's a good day for invasions
5 clips in less than an hour<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>epic<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i guess no one expects the weapon art because it starts the same as normal perserverance
and barely anyone uses it<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah
ive literally never seen anyone use it
not just the weapon art but i think the weapon
but that's a good example of its bad range and damage
well damage is okay
that wasnt full damage<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>the only hammer can think that might be used less is gargoyle flame hammer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>it couldve done ~500<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>and that one has an even weirder weapon art<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i could add it to the build
i think<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>yeah i could<|end-block|>

Did u have xps 13 or 15<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>15<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Okie<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>What was the issue with the xps again
Battery life?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no
thermals
the sleek design of it makes it thermal throttle a lot
also it does have quality issues
you could get a complete dud and have to return it
i got lucky
and so did alan
the battery life is alright
not great but manageable<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you can treat it by undervolting your cpu
and repasting the CPU cause the pasting job the factory does is really shit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Huh, okay<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>The 9500?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I have a 9500
After one battery replacement it works proper<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i have a 9570 and ive never had to do anytihng other than repaste my cpu<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I have a 95000000<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I'm choosing between the macbook pro 13" and the xps 15<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Kinda leaning towards the 15<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>If 15 you can prob game a bit<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>was considering the older model<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>but the bezels on the 9500 r so nice<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Then get the 9500<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Only bad part about new xps is no ryzen<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Tbh just choose whichever looks nicer
Performance differences is negligible at these specs<|end-block|>

<|start-block|>i thought it was a trick question

<|start-block|>D is very clearly the right answer<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>you're asking me an impossible question
oh man
i'm sweating bullets<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>Katy Perry has released more bangers than Taylor Swift
Although "We are never ever getting back together" is a great song<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>i like both of their old music (maybe katy perry more) but i like taylor swift's new music more<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>katy perry probably has better personality tho idk<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>my only recollection of each artists music was their radio presence in like early 2010s
therefore katy perry is the victor<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>lmao fair
so what made you think of this question<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>I was playing a game under the alias taylorswiftfan24 and someone told me katy perry was better<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>now i'm all sorts of confused
you just voted for katy perry<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>taylorswiftfan rolls off the tongue better than katy perry fan
Uk?<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>not particularly
i find the "ftf" part harder to pronounce<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>fair enough
taylorswift sounds better than katy perry imo<|end-block|>
<|start-block|>no<|end-block|>

or a run-on sentence
<@!151470394363084800><|end-block|>
